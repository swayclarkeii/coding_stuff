# Fathom MCP Server - Usage Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

The dependencies are already installed in your virtual environment. To verify:

```

### 2. Running the Server

#### Option A: Direct Python Execution

```bash
export FATHOM_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
python server.py
```

#### Option B: Using fastmcp CLI

```bash
export FATHOM_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
fastmcp run server.py
```

#### Option C: Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv run --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py
```

### 3. Claude Desktop Integration

## Testing the Server

You can test the server directly with Python:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from server import make_request

async def test():
    # List meetings
    meetings = await make_request("GET", "/meetings", params={"limit": 5})
    print(f"Found {len(meetings['items'])} meetings")

    # Get a summary
    if meetings['items']:
        recording_id = meetings['items'][0]['recording_id']
        summary = await make_request("GET", f"/recordings/{recording_id}/summary")
        print(f"Summary: {summary}")

asyncio.run(test())
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

**Error:** "FATHOM_API_KEY environment variable is required"
**Solution:** Make sure the API key is set in your environment or `.env` file

### Rate Limit Errors

**Error:** "Rate limit exceeded. Reset in X seconds."
**Solution:** The API allows 60 requests per 60 seconds. Wait for the reset time or implement exponential backoff.

### Authentication Errors

**Error:** "Authentication failed. Please check your FATHOM_API_KEY."
**Solution:** Verify your API key is correct and hasn't been revoked. Get a new key from [Fathom Settings](https://app.fathom.video/settings/integrations).

### Resource Not Found

**Error:** "Resource not found."
**Solution:** Check that the recording ID or webhook ID exists and you have permission to access it.

## API Limitations

- **Rate Limit:** 60 requests per 60 seconds
- **Access Scope:** API keys can only access meetings you recorded or meetings shared with your team
- **Admin Keys:** Admin API keys do NOT automatically grant access to all users' meetings
