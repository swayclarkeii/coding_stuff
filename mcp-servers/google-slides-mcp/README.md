# Google Slides MCP Server

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the Google Slides API. It allows you to create, read, and modify Google Slides presentations programmatically.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js)
*   Google Cloud Project with the Google Slides API enabled.
*   OAuth 2.0 Credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) for your Google Cloud Project.
*   A Google Refresh Token associated with the OAuth 2.0 credentials and the necessary Google Slides API scopes.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure you are in the project directory.**

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the Server:**
    Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `build` directory containing the compiled JavaScript code.

4.  **Obtain Google API Credentials:**
    *   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project or select an existing one.
    *   Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Enabled APIs & services".
    *   Click "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES", search for "Google Slides API", and enable it.
    *   Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
    *   Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "OAuth client ID".
    *   If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen. For "User type", choose "External" unless you have a Google Workspace account and want to restrict it internally. Provide an app name, user support email, and developer contact information.
    *   On the "Scopes" page during consent screen setup, click "ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES". Search for and add the following scopes:
        *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations` (To view and manage your presentations)
        *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` (Required for duplicating presentations - allows access to files created or opened by the app)
    *   Save the consent screen configuration.
    *   Go back to "Credentials", click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "OAuth client ID".
    *   Select "Desktop app" as the Application type.
    *   Give it a name (e.g., "Slides MCP Client").
    *   Click "Create". You will see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. **Copy these down securely.** You can also download the JSON file containing these credentials.

5.  **Obtain a Google Refresh Token:**
    *   A refresh token allows the server to obtain new access tokens without requiring user interaction each time. Generating one typically involves a one-time authorization flow.
    *   You can use the [Google OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) for this:
        *   Go to the OAuth 2.0 Playground.
        *   Click the gear icon (Settings) in the top right.
        *   Check "Use your own OAuth credentials".
        *   Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you obtained in the previous step.
        *   In the "Step 1 - Select & authorize APIs" section on the left, find "Slides API v1" and select the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations` scope. Also find "Drive API v3" and select the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` scope.
        *   Click "Authorize APIs".
        *   Sign in with the Google account you want the server to act on behalf of.
        *   Grant the requested permissions.
        *   You will be redirected back to the Playground. In "Step 2 - Exchange authorization code for tokens", you should see the **Refresh token** and Access token. **Copy the Refresh token securely.**

    Alternatively, you can use the provided `get-token` script to obtain a refresh token. This script will build the project and then run a utility that guides you through the OAuth flow to get a refresh token. Ensure your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are configured in your environment or a `.env` file if the script requires them (you may need to check the `src/getRefreshToken.ts` file for details on how it expects credentials). To run the script:

    ```bash
    npm run get-token
    ```

6.  **Configure Credentials and Command in MCP Settings:**
    Locate your MCP settings file (e.g., `.../User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`). Find or create the entry for `"google-slides-mcp"` and configure it with the command to run the server and your credentials:
    ```json
    "google-slides-mcp": {
      "transportType": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/google-slides-mcp/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
        "GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
      }
      // ... other optional settings like description ...
    }
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/google-slides-mcp/build/index.js` with the actual path to the compiled server index file on your system. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN` with the actual values you obtained. The MCP runner will inject these values into the server's environment when it starts.

## Running the Server

Execute the compiled code:

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will start and listen for MCP requests on standard input/output (stdio). You should see a message like: `Google Slides MCP server running and connected via stdio.`

## Available Tools

The server exposes the following tools via the Model Context Protocol:

*   **`create_presentation`**: Creates a new Google Slides presentation.
    *   **Input:**
