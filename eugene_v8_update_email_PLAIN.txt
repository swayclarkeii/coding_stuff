Subject: Document Organizer Update - Build Complete, Now Testing

Hi Eugene,

Quick update on your automated document organizer:

Where We're At:
We've finished building the V8 system and are now in the testing phase. The core automation is working end-to-end.

What's Been Achieved:

1. Intelligent Document Classification - The system now automatically reads your PDFs and determines what type of document they are (Verkaufspreise, Wirtschaftliche Unterlagen, etc.) with high accuracy

2. Automatic German Naming - Files get renamed to proper German terms that match your folder structure (e.g., "Verkaufspreise" for purchase price documents)

3. Full Automation - From the moment you email a PDF, the system handles everything: sorting it, classifying it, renaming it, and filing it in the correct folder

Real-World Performance:
Based on actual document tests, the system processes each PDF in about 15-20 seconds from email arrival to final filing.

Next Steps:
1. Run through more test documents to validate edge cases
2. Make any final adjustments based on what we find
3. Switch to live production mode

I'll keep you posted as testing progresses.

Best,
Sway
