        "timestamp": "00:01:20",
        "text": "The main issues are: 1) We manually copy-paste content between platforms, 2) No automated scheduling, 3) We miss deadlines because of manual tracking. It's costing us about $2000 per month in lost productivity."

        "text": "We tried Zapier but it didn't handle our complex workflows. We need something that can integrate with our custom CMS at ambush.tv and also handle multi-platform posting."

        "speaker": "Sinbad",
        "timestamp": "00:03:15",
        "text": "Ideally, we'd reduce manual work by 80%, have automated scheduling across all platforms, and get back those 8 hours per week. That would free up our team to focus on creative work instead of admin tasks."
