 Now we're going to make an amazing butter. And this is sort of the start of the most important part, keeping that bird incredibly moist. Soft butter. I touch a salt and pepper. It will touch up all of all in there. That stops the butter from burning. Next, I have the zest of two lemons. And they're juice. This gives the flavor butter a wonderful citrus thing. Three cloves of garlic. Turkey's a very delicate, dainty meat. And that's why I want the garlic pureed. So it's sort of disintegrates. And flavours are turkey. Gently without becoming too overpowering. Then at a generous handful of chopped parsley. Wow, that smells incredibly light. Give that a good mix. Turkey's a very, very lean bird and it dries out. So it's so important to make sure that we help it to cook perfectly. I've got it done. Now prepare the turkey. We're a season in the bird. Inside the cavity. Salt and pepper. Next half two onions and potnamen. As they roast, they steam inside the bird, giving it a lovely sweetness. Put in the lemon and a couple of bay leaves for their better sweet spicy flavour. We're sort of lining the inside of the turkey with these fantastic sort of flavours. You can see the bird is upright and it's looking sort of like it's standing to attention. Now it's time to add the flavored butter. Just very, very carefully open up the skin. Go through, over the back, at the breast and keep the skin intact. The idea is to gently loosen the skin with your fingers so the butter can be stopped and then eat it. Now what you've lose all the skin, off the top of the thighs, turn the bird around, and just go through here again, hand up and just release a little bit. But don't completely break it because I don't want all that butter to run out. Right? From there, now take your butter, put it into a ball, that smells amazing. Lemonade, citrusy and just sort of flatten it and stick that in there underneath, one side. Now what you've got it in there, pull back the skin and just use that sort of slide all the way down. What we're going to do now is line the top of the breast, the wet butter there. That butter is going to keep the turkey breast really seriously moist. Turn the bird around. And finish covering the breast with the butter. Turkey's originally came from North America and they're best young and plump. My favorite breed for Christmas is either North at Black or North at Bronze, both of which have a wonderful gamey taste. Take the rest of the butter and carefully massage over the breast, legs and wings. You can do all this the night before and simply cover the turkey with tin foil and keep it in the fridge ready to be cooked on Christmas day. Into the tray. And it will touch of olive oil. Now, olive oil on top, again, that protects it. Guess that skin really nice and crispy, and it stops the butter from burning. Now, in the oven, a 220 for 10 minutes get really nice and brown quickly. In she goes. Beautiful. Now, smells fantastic. After 10 minutes, take the turkey out of the oven and baste. Then cover the breast with smoked streaky bacon. What I want to do is add a little bit more flavor. I'm already starting to think about my gravy. So the bacon protects it. It stops it from drying out. But it's going to start to really give my gravy a wonderful base. Turn down the oven to 180 degrees. This five kilogram bird will feed eight people comfortably. It needs roasting for two and a half hours or half an hour per kilo, basting every so often. Back in. And now, she's on the way. Look at that. Beautiful. That smells fantastic. Wow. Look at that. Beautiful. That. There's 90% of your work done there. To test the turkey is cooked, stick a knife into the bottom of the thigh. And if the juicy's run clear, it's done. The secret now is to let the turkey rest uncovered for two and a half hours. As the meat relaxes, it reabsorbs its juices, making it succulent and tender. Plus it'll be easier to carve. It might seem like a long time to let it rest. But remember, the turkey doesn't need to be piping hot because I'm serving it with hot gravy. That. It looks like a million dollars. Let that rest. Because the flavor will be ten times more exciting once it's rested. As that turkey's rested, I want to make the most amazing gravy. When I say it amazing, I really do mean amazing. Drame the excess fat on the roasting tray and put it back on the heat. Then remove the bacon from the top of the turkey and the roasted onions from the cavity. Look at them. My god, they smell amazing. Finally, take out the roasted lemon. First of all, cut up the bacon. Lovely. Bacon into the tray. Here are crispy lettuce. Best to start are that gravy. The onion. Look at it. Beautiful. It does get any better than that. Chop that up. Onion and bacon in. That. Smells incredible. My first got the chance to cook Christmas lunch for the chefs in Paris. They taught me one crucial thing. I was only 21 at the time and they made me rest the turkey as long as I cooked it. So I cooked it for three hours and I rested it for three hours. What a difference. Incredible. Next, chop up the roasted lemon and add to the tray. Put in a couple of sprigs of rosemary to give it a lovely aromatic punch and fry. Then add three chopped tomatoes which helps thicken the gravy and give it a lovely fresh taste. Now it's time to really get the turkey flavour into the gravy. Now, off the wing. Take off all your little trimmings. Take these little bits here and that into your gravy. These are the bits we now have a fewx. Everyone throws them away. Off. There. A little baby there. Take them off. I want that. Bang. Flavour. Delicious. Fire it off. The smell is incredible. Next, pour in the dry cider. This adds a lovely subtle apple flavour that really lifts the taste of the turkey meat. As the cider starts to reduce, pour in the delicious resting juices from the roasted turkey. Wow. There you go. It's almost amazing flavour. When the liquid has reduced by half, crush the vegetables and the turkey pieces with a masher to extract the maximum amount of flavour. And basically what's happening now is that we're giving the gravy a little bit of body. Pour in the chicken stock and reduce again. Now, I'm not taste. Wow. And we just close your eyes and it's well. It oozes flavour and turkey. Now, siv it. Use the back of the ladle to push it through the sieve, extracting every last drop of flavour. Pop in a sprig of rosemary and lead to infuse ready for the finishing touch. Simply add crushed walnuts to the bottom of the gravy boat and ladle in the hot gravy. I'm just going to do again a little twist of the potatoes. We do need some goose flour. No, no. Oh, god. It's good. It's good. We're going to do a really nice, lightly spiced roast potato. A little chilli flakes. Really? Yeah, chilli flakes. Just put a little bit of heat in there. When a Christmas slunch? Yep. Tilly flakes and a little bit of turmeric. I can't believe you're doing rosemary to switch on it. Right. Now, would you be so kind just to give them a little counts? Cut the peel potatoes into quarters and put into salted cold water. Then they go. Okay. Bring them up to the boil and simmer for around 8 minutes. Drain and let them steam. Then season with salt and pepper. And just a little teaspoon of chilli flakes. No? That's a sort of thing I would make for supper and a salad in there. Really? Chini flakes in. Add a teaspoon of turmeric. Turmeric is a member of the ginger family. It stains the potato's wonderful golden colour and has a lovely, earthy taste. Next, drizzle in a little olive oil and shake to coat them. Just let them roll around. Yep. That smells nice. Beautiful. Could you get me the... They're stopping, please, from the fridge. Put in a preheated baking tray with extra olive oil. And cook at 200 degrees Celsius for about 40 minutes. Give it a little shake to make sure they don't stick. And now just stick the stuffing. Thank you, Ron. On top there. Now, now we'll take roughly about the same time as potatoes. Stuffing in. Potatoes, though. Nice. Why don't you go play with the kids? I will do it here. Okay. See you shortly. Bye bye. Now, they look and smell fantastic. Look at that. Be beautiful. Chicken with garlic and chestnut stuffing. Pack with flavour and earthy richness. For the stuffing, fry finely chopped onion. Garlic. And celery in hot olive oil. Next, add pine nuts, which have a lovely creamy taste. And chopped earthy cooked chestnuts. Both add a wonderfully chewy texture and richness to stuffing. Season. And add chopped parsley. Then stirring cooked while rice. Next, take a whole deep-burn chicken. It's filling to do at home. But if you ask, you'll butcher will do it for you. And par the stuffing mixture along the center. Now, simply roll the chicken up tightly and tie it with your butcher's string. Then roast in a hot oven for just over an hour. Simply carve into magnificent thick slices. So impressive, so easy and trust me. This is a dish guaranteed to get a fantastic reaction on any occasion. Turkey, the one hit wonder. And absolutely amazing, bro. Stuff, onion, orange, garlic, thyme and bay leaf. Season. Truffle butter. This little beauty helps to take the turkey to a different division. These cost 50 quid for that size. Yes, it's expensive, but boys are worth it. Don't chop the truffle too small because we want a taste and identify the truffle. Parsley. Tarringon. Salt, touch a pepper. Table spoon of olive oil. And that stops the butter from burning. Take your piping bag and fill it. Separate skin from meat. Pying bag in. Pying butter. Mass art. Salt, pepper, olive oil. Roast. Citrus bread crumbs. Panchetta. Onion. Time. You know, you just have good old chest stricks and pull down. And just peel it off. It's lovely flowers. Pine nut. Butter. Bread. Orange. Lemon. And it's starting to brownie. Sprinkle. Your orange and lemon breadcrumbs. Lemon juice. There you go. Beautiful. Reft. Timful keeps nice and warm and it cooled down slowly. So the breast become really nice and moist. Car. What you can smell, of course, is that amazing truffle. Absolutely beautiful. Tuck you with chuffle butter and citrus breadcrumbs. Done.
