 OCR hits 99% in accuracy, but still people decide not to use it. Why? OCR itself is not a solution. A system which you can build around it is. And today I'm going to show you how this system might look like. My name is Tomasz and I help operation teams to automate manual soul crushing tasks. I spent last 15 years solving logistic problems from warehouse layout redesign to network design at S&P 500 Company. Today I apply the same understand process first approach to AI automation. And I shared the framework which I use to automate without breaking what already works. By the end of this video I'm going to show you how the system which capture PDFs and pictures might look like and how it's going to bring value to your organization. Here is what you're going to cover today. I will show you where exactly the gap is and where OCR itself is great, but where it also felt short. Then I will walk you through the complete build and all of the elements which system supposed to have. After that live demo you're going to see how real life scenario is being processed by automation. Then we're going to look at more real case scenarios and in the end I going to tell you what doesn't mean for your organization. Let's start with addressing where the gap is. OCR does one things extremely well. It converts text from pictures and PDFs, but he is something what OCR doesn't do. It doesn't organize the text into folders and searchable data. Without the system which going to organize all of these files you're just going to end up with the list of files which nobody knows what is what. We know what is the gap. Let's talk how to address this gap. What do you need in end to end system to process the documents? Everything starts with OCR engine. There is at least four major engines on the market which performs very well and hitting around 99% accuracy. Next to engine you need a brain. LLM model like Charge GPT or Cloud which going to interpret the data and extract that's what is important for you. Unique file naming. Every piece of data which going to go to the system needs to have a clear and recognizable name with timestamp. When the files are extracted and they have a name they also need a place where to leave. Next one on the list is error handling system. Everything which is extracted in complete on in a wrong way needs to be flagged for your intervention. Last one on the list integration layer. It's allowed to connect all of the tools which you already have in place like Gmail on Excel in one working system. Okay, enough theory. I'm going to show you how the real system can operate with invoices. What are we going to see is me making a picture of one printed invoice which will be processed by the system and second how I'm going to process two PDFs attached to an email. Here is my goal. I don't want to show you exactly how I build it and what exactly each note does. I just want to show you a practical example of the workflow which you can recognize from your organization. Okay, so this is an example of the invoice which I have with some handwritten text. I'm going to make a picture of this invoice. I'm going to send it to dedicated inbox. Okay, email is sent. Now I just going to wait a second so my email can receive it. Okay, so here is the workflow which I built. In general it's just checking the receive emails and look for any invoices. Next is generating the unique ID which I mentioned is very important. Then it's going through the processing and here is our engine, the MISTRAL OCR system. Then it's going through OpenAI model to interpretate and extract the most important information. Then I build a system which gonna storage the picture of the invoice for a later review. It's gonna create a record in a data table and it's also gonna add a label to the sent email so I know this invoice was processed. In this example I'm gonna execute this manually but that's something that you can set up to run every 15 minutes every hour every day. That's really something of your preference. I'm just gonna see how my invoice is being processed. Now OpenAI interprets that to create a link in my Google drive so I can always take a look on this invoice. Okay, so this is processed. We're gonna go to the table and as you see the new line is just created and I can always see invoice itself and I can also see what information were extracted and as you see also the written text is here. It's not ideal but it's good enough. Okay, and now the second example I have two PDFs invoices attached to an email. Something what I would like to pay attention this time is that it's gonna choose a different path because those are PDFs. They're gonna go through the document path but the rest is the same. They will be assigned with the unique ID number. They will be processed by our engine, OCR. Then our brain OpenAI, charge IPT in this case gonna extract the documents, gonna extract the data which we need. The copies will be saved to my Google drive. Then you're gonna create a record in the database and then you're gonna label this sent emails as processed. Okay, so let's see how the flow is going. We're generating unique IDs. Mral OCR is processing the text, charge IPT is extracting and interpreting the data. We creating copy in our Google drive. Then we're going to create a record in our data table and we're also going to label the emails which we sent. Here is two additional invoices as you see one of them actually was in Polish. I forget to mention and our mother was able to capture a different currency and as planned it also captured the copy on our Google drive so we can always go back to the PDF if we need this in the future instead of going through the emails and looking for the attached PDF. Everything is organized by the unique number in our data table and our Google drive. Point here is not to show you how exactly it's built. The point here is to show what the system can do for you. This kind of solutions are custom built. If you work in the office and you're receiving your documents via email as attached PDFs, if you are some other who spends time on a road and need to make pictures of the receipts it's also going to work for you. It really depends what is your situation, what tools are you already using and how the system going to support your current situation. OCR is powerful, it's accurate but it is just an engine. Without that system it's just another disconnected tool. If you want to utilize the full potential you need to think about your entire workflow and address every step of this process. I hope you enjoyed. I hope you learned something new and as always I hope you're going to start automating your operation today.
