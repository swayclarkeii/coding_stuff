 If you think Cloud Code is just for developer, you're missing something huge. Cloud Code runs my entire business. And I'm not a developer. This is not about code. It's about business leverage. In this course, I will show you every features and mechanism in Cloud Code that matters for business. Not theory, not fluff, real tasks, real results. Cloud Code solves every limitation of face with chat GPT, Gemini, or even Tandart Code. The memory problem, the context problem, the scattered work problem, gone. I am Darren Viner and I coach business owners in the world first AI community, the AAA by Liam Otley. For the last three years, I've spent thousands of our building system with AI agents for real business scenarios. Now, let's dive in. Okay, let's start. Why are we stuck with chat GPT and other AI tools? First problem is context window management issue. We are limited by the context window. And the models, whatever the platform, Cloud, chat GPT, Gemini, take whatever platform, they all have the same problem. The model lose performance as the context feels. There is lots of details. The model forgets important stuff and at the end, I'll eliminate another big issue is the silo sessions. You cannot share context across chat sessions or across projects or between custom GPT in a easy manner. And it's a real problem when you're working on complex projects with different information scattered among different folder, different some project or different location inside, Cloud, chat GPT and so on. Really, that's a huge limit. Then there is another prime, which is the self orchestration problems. In chat GPT, you can use teams of custom GPT but you have to call them manually using the add command. In Cloud, you cannot do this. In Gemini, you cannot use multiple James in one chat sessions. And so in all those tools, you have to orchestrate manually either with a command like in chat GPT or copy pasting stuff between chat sessions, between project, between gems, between different chat sessions. And so that's paying another thing that is painful. This tool is the connection with external tool. Let's face it, you can connect chat GPT with connectors or clone with connectors and clothe. But it's still very early and it's still basic. Like for instance, the Google connector, the Google Drive Connector, Google Sheet and Google Docs connectors. You cannot even have your custom GPT or your Cloud project write Google Docs. That's crazy. So it's useless for me. And in addition to that, even if you use OpenAI's Kima with custom GPT inside chat GPT, it's clunky. Let's face it. It's techy. It's not straightforward. I really, I hate it. And when you use it, it's really painful. You have to always authorize connection and so on. That's, wow, my God, that's so hard for nothing. Right? So the capability to connect with external API is really limited. Then you have all these other tools like N8 and Mac.com, Zap here and so on. All these automation tools. And at the end of the day, when you want to do automated workflows, you need to combine all these tools. It's really techy. Once again, it's brittle. Even if you don't pay any money, you will spend time. It's expensive to build, expensive to use, expensive to maintain. And it becomes obsolete very fast. Think about it. OpenAI is just really is agent builder when I'm recording his video, which means tools like N8 and or Mac.com must likely they can be threatened by that. Who knows if N8 ends will still be something in six months? Not sure. I'm not making any prediction here because I don't know and anything can happen. But just to show you that this complex tools, you take time to learn them. And then you have to learn something else because now it's not it's not the best way to do stuff any longer. Once again, what we do here is not technical. We want to use simple AI tools that are evergreen. Let's face it, if you work with CusGvT, it will last longer than working with specific AI tools. And here what I will show you working with Code Code is definitely the future. And it is there to stay for a very simple reason. And trapping is investing massively on upgrading this tool, maintaining this tool, making it better, adding features, adding capabilities. So it's just the beginning. Which means it's the right time to jump on trade and sign out here. The Cloud Code is initially it's a tool that is built for coders, but actually don't need to note any code to work with it. And in particular with what I will show you, which means using Cloud Code inside Visual Studio code and with the Cloud Code extensions, you will see it's like it actually. It's an experience that is quite close to a chatbot. So you don't need any text skills to use what I will show you. And the original thing that we do in CCGN that I show you in this course is that we are using Cloud Code, not for code, but for business related work using AI agents using processes systems inside Cloud Code, leveraging the capabilities of Cloud Code, but for business purpose. And that's really super powerful and super easy actually. Once you have the right system, once you know how to use a Cloud Code capabilities in a business context, that's pretty straightforward. So now let's see how to install Cloud Code in few seconds. It's very easy to install Cloud Code. I recommend to use Visual Studio Code. It's free and then to install Cloud Code extension and then the only thing that remains to be done, it's authenticate with paid Cloud subscription. And once again, I recommend you to use your paid Cloud subscription rather than the API because you can also use Cloud Code with the Antropic API, but if you use the Antropic API, you will pay for every token you use. And I don't like this approach. Why? Because basically you're paying for mistakes that AI will do when AI consumed too much content. It's because AI is not effective enough to do the job in a limited amount of token. And so I don't want to pay attention to the number of token that the AI is using. Right? So that's why I recommend to use the paid Cloud subscription. So let me show you how it looks. First you go in Visual Studio Code and here you choose the right one for you. I'm on Windows, so I would download the file here and I would just execute it and I would just follow instructions. It's really straightforward. Then when you are in Visual Studio Code, you go in extension here. You look for Cloud Code and here you have Cloud Code for VS Code. You click on that and then you can install it. For me, it's already installed. So I won't do it, but you click install and it will do everything alone. And the first time that you launch Cloud Code and to launch Cloud Code, you just have to be in a folder. So let's open a folder. This one, for instance, once you're there, you just click on a file or somewhere and you will see that here. You can launch with the upper right corner. You can launch as many Cloud Code sessions you want. And so the first time you connect with Cloud Code, before I think this beautiful interface, you would have something that says, hey, authenticate and then you can choose the method between API or between your Cloud subscription. And I recommend to use the Cloud subscription. And it's ready for you. You click on it. It will open the browser and then you just say accept or you just read what is on screen. Follow the process. It's really, really easy straightforward. And you'll get to go as easy as that. And you see no coding, no nothing. It's pretty simple. And you will see visuals to your code is really simple because it's a bit like Windows. You have folders with files and you can navigate into computer there. And then you have a bunch of features in Visual Studio Code, but that's not the point of this course to explain that to you. We discover you will see it's pretty straightforward. Just quick tip. You can see in a Cloud Code session here, I have access to the past conversation. Here, I don't have any, but in a folder I have worked on, for instance, that one here. If I open another Clouds.co session, now I have past conversations. Okay. So that means I can find my past conversation if I need to. So pretty simple. That's it. You now you're ready. First thing to understand is the memory system. This is what we'll be covering next. Yeah. When you first connect with Cloud Code or sometimes when your access token has expired, Cloud Code will tell you that you need to you need to login again. And so you use the command slash login and then you will end up on this screen. And then that's where you can choose between Cloud AI subscription or entropy console, which is the API or this. I've never used that. And so you click a I then you have this box. You say yes, then it opens this in your browser. And then you just click authorized and you're good to go. Then you go back to your interface, Cloud Code interface. The Cloud dot MD file that's your business brain. All that's the brain in more general context as the brain of Cloud Code. The Cloud dot MD file is a bit like a system prompt. And actually you can have a Cloud dot MD file in any folder you are working on with Cloud Code. This is some sort of permanent instruction files that you can use at each folder and for each project you're working on. Really, it's like a system. If you have work with chat GPT project, it's like the custom instruction for chat GPT project. If you have work with custom GPT, it's like the system prompt of the system GPT and same for Cloud project. If you work with Cloud project, you have custom instruction for Cloud project. So here the Cloud dot MD file is the same same concept. The thing to understand is that for each folder, you can have a Cloud dot MD file. And so if you have a folder with subfolder and so on, you can basically have a IRT of project folder. And for each of them, you can have a Cloud dot MD file. And the cool stuff is that each time you open a Cloud Code session inside a folder, it will look for a Cloud dot MD file to get instruction and context of what we were working on in this folder. All proud in this course. And we call folder project. It's the same. We use the same the two words for the same concept. So obviously the advantage is of that is that you don't have to re-explain a project context or business context. You can have different instruction per project or per folders. You can compounds the knowledge because each time you're working on a project, you can ask to update the Cloud dot MD file so that the permanent memory or the system prompt, if you prefer, is always up to date. So it's super powerful. You can also use that to have some mechanism that Cloud Code will execute. When it opens, you can like really the sky is dealing with this super effect. Cloud Code can help you design the Cloud dot MD file of course, but you can also decide and tell Cloud Code to put stuff you file. You find important for a given project or given folder inside a Cloud dot MD file. So let's have a look at the Cloud dot MD file. Here I am in my CCGG business operation. And if I open a project, for instance, this one, you can see here I have a Cloud dot MD file. And you can see here, this is the a Markdowns file with information about the project, the scope, etc. And if I go in another sub project, for instance, this one, once again, I have a Cloud dot MD file somewhere. So now, Cloud as memory and context with the Cloud dot MD file, what if you need multiple AI teams working in parallel? That's where some agent come in. Some agents are AI workers inside Cloud Code. The cool stuff with them is that there are specialized AI assistants. They have isolated context window, each context window has 200,000 tokens available to the date of this video. That means you don't pollute the main context when you're working with agents. The cool stuff with agents is that Cloud Code can call them automatically, invoke them and Cloud Code can run them in parallel. All can run them sequentially according to the work they are doing. There's some agents have access to the files in the folder you're working on. And so they can communicate with each other using the file they have access to or Cloud Code can also pass context I've seen that Cloud Code can pass information from one agent to the other sharing context. Okay, this is technical. It doesn't really matter just Cloud Code can orchestrate automatically sub agents sharing context between the different agents, even if each sub agent has its own context window. So the advantage is you can run multiple tasks at one. So you can go faster. You can specialize them as well. So that can be a team of specialized sub agent that work on the workflow orchestrated by Cloud Code, not by you. You don't have to do it. Of course, if you want to specifically ask Cloud Code to work with a given sub agent, you can do it. No problem. But that's super useful. And at the end, what a sub agent is. It's a dot and defy. So let's look at this. This is my GPT Express Mastery team. It's my I call that my HR department. This is where I build all my sub agent in Cloud Code and also where I build all my custom GPTs when I'm working on chat GP. Okay. And so an agent is you can see here in my HR team, I have several agents. They correspond to my GPT Express Mastery framework. If you've watched the course inside CCG community. And if I open one, this one, for instance, you can see that an agent has always the same metadata here. And in the metadata, I have the name, I have the description of the sole agent. It's mission. That's what Cloud Code will use to know what this agent does and also to invoke automatically the same agent if the task match the description. You can specify the model. You can spend specify a color, especially if you're working on terminals. They can see what agent is working. And you can also specify the tool it has access to. It's optional, but you can do the classical procedure to create an agent in Cloud Code is using the command agents. And here, consider agents. I will have to continue in terminal because here I'm in the extension for Visual Studio Code. But if you want to make the slash agents come and work, you need to go into terminal. So if I go into terminal, it looks like this. And then I have the list of agents I've access to in my system. And if I want to create a new agent, I can just click here. And then I can choose between project or personal. If I put my agent in project, that means the agent is available at the project level in the folder I'm working on. If I put it in personal, here, that means the agent will be available everywhere. That's a hierarchy of availability. That is true for agents, for skills, for MCPs, for all the key features of Cloud Code. You can either have them available globally or have them available locally. I won't create any agent because once again, I don't I don't use this approach to create agents. What I use to create agents is my HR team. And for instance, here, here I have my team working on an agent. It's an example that I starting just to show you. I just said, hey, I need an agent. Can answer questions about Cloud Code for business. Then what did Cloud Code it refine my demand? Or at least it identified inputs it needed and started answering the inputs automatically. So I can review. I said, okay. And then what it did, it created a folder that is this GPT project Cloud Code business expert. It's in there, Cloud Code business expert. And then it called multiple agents to work on this sub agent creation or discussion GPT creation. First, the purpose, the purpose refiner that refine the purpose statement. And here it's the better definition of what the agent is meant to do better than what I did initially. And then you can see here that's the two do's of Cloud Code using different sub agents to work one after the other executing my GPT express mastery framework to craft custom GPT's. And then you can see a good example of parallel execution. So it's not some agents that are execute executing in parallel. Here, it's the web search tool that is used by Cloud Code in parallel. That means Cloud Code is making these different queries in parallel to go faster. Okay, a bunch of query to collect knowledge and then it's fetching several URL to collect knowledge some other web search queries. And it's still making some research. And then after we'd craft the knowledge base and then the system prompt and then potentially some tools. And then I'm good. I have my custom GPT's on my sub agent ready to rock and roll. I call that my HR team. And this is something that is available in CCG here in the Cloud Code OS so that you can plug it immediately just copy paste it and have it available inside your Cloud Code environment without spending time setting this up. It's already done and available in Cloud Code OS. So sub agents and a complex task, but what if you need reusable workflows or standard SOP standard operating procedure that activate automatically and that Cloud Code can call in anywhere globally, which means these are standard way of working that you can use in any project anywhere in Cloud Code. That's skills. Okay, consider skills as reusable workflows or standard operating procedure, which means when you know how to do something well and you want it to be done always the same time by Cloud Code, you will create a skill and this skill can be called in any folder in any project. So the key feature of skills is that. Cloud can trigger them automatically can can use the skill automatically according to the work show ask it to do. It will detect context match then skills are re optimized for context window. Using a mechanism that is called progressive disclosure, which mean when Cloud Code uses skills, it won't load the entire skills. He just start discovering what the skills about reading the beginning of it and then reading more if needed and that's really super useful for context window optimization and other cool thing with skills is that skills mix deterministic code. You can put scripts inside skills and also knowledge files that can be processed by LLM, which mean you combine both world code for the deterministic tasks and LLM for. Flexible AI automation or AI execution, let's go. And finally, another stuff that is cool with skills is there they are shareable, which mean first and foremost, you can use them globally on your system in many different projects don't have to specify again. They are available and also you can package them and share them with other people, for instance, with your customers or for instance, with your teammates, which mean you can enforce SOPs. You can ensure that your teammates using Cloud Code or your employees using Cloud Code will use the right SOP because you share the skill with them. And guess what? In the Cloud Code OS, I'm sharing the skill I use for myself and I build for myself. I share them with you so that you can use them right away. It's copy-pasting so simple. So like I told you, the advantage of skill is context window friendliness and you know how much context window friendliness matters for a large language model performance. Reusable across projects globally and you are from Cloud Code except if you put the skill in one single folder, then they are available only on this folder. But if you put them globally and this is what I advise you to do, if you put them to the dot cloud sub folder and your user folder, they are available globally. Closed this side automatically how to use them. If you want to be unsure that cloud use the right skill, you can also tell it to use the right skill. And the cool stuff is that you build once a skill and you can use it anywhere and guess what? You can also improve the skill. Right. So let me show you what a skill looks like. Okay, here I'm in the dot cloud folder in my user folder on Windows. And so that means everything that is there is globally available everywhere in my Cloud Code environment. Let's check skills factory. Guess what? And they went on topic really skills of a few weeks ago. I guess three weeks ago now. The first thing I crafted is a skill to create other skills. Obviously I did that in the past. The first custom GPT I created or maybe the third one I created is a custom GPT to create other customers. And back in the day, the first sophisticated prompt I created was met what I call I used to call meta prompt was a prompt to create other prompt was in February 2023. Anyways, so this is how skills looks like a skill as always a skill dot and the file any skill as a skill dot and the fact can see here. There is another one, etc. And so a skill dot and the file basically has once again, meta data. You will see that in Cloud Code all files all system files. Let's call them that way as always a meta data that help Cloud code understand what it is what it does when to invoke it. Right. So here's saying for skills we have skill dot and the file with this metadata the name of the skill, the description of the skill as simple as that. And then you have a description of the skill what it does the process inside. Basically it's defined how Cloud code should do the work when it's applying the skills. You can see it's pretty short file, right. And if we check the outline of it can see in this specific one, if we check the outline of the skill dot and the file for the skills factory. There is the meta data. There is a more extended description for it does. There is a skill creation process. There is some troubleshooting. There is some reference documentation. And that's the progressive disclosure when Cloud code see reference documentation. It says how I have some other document that I have access to. So potentially I can retrieve them some examples skills some script and some version history. Okay. See it as a table of content. And then in the skill I have some other documents. So that's a knowledge about how to do the skills properly. And you can have also code here. I have some scripts. So these are Python script that Cloud code will execute when it's using the script. I can give you an example about how skills are used. For instance, I have a skill that is my standard operating procedure to create new projects. Inside my business OS, that's the project creator skill. And so let me show you how it looks like in real life. If I am in my CCG business operation system. So that's the one. Let's create a project using a skill. Okay. By the way, this operating system has many super useful processes mechanism and so on. That makes it super effective to run any aspect of my business. And guess what? It's available in Cloud code OS so that you can copy paste it with all the mechanism and the routine already set and you can tweak them and make them specific for your own business. And of course, the implementation calls inside Cloud code OS are meant to help you customize it for your business. This implementation calls our group group call we do about each system I share inside Cloud code. And it's also Q and A code so that when you have question about implementing your Cloud code OS systems, I can help you back in the main topic. So here, let me illustrate how to use skills. All skills is used by code. So I will create a mock project so that I can show you all code code called project creation skill to create the project the right way inside my CCG business operation. So that would be a mock project just to show you what work. Hey, use the right skill to create a project inside CCG business operation. That's a mock project just to demonstrate how you invoke skills to do stuff specifically here to create a mock project. Right. Oh, that's a clunky ask I did here, but it should work. So here you can see it's calling the skill project creator and it's reading it's discovering it's discovering the skill that's progressive disclosure. Then the process is normally asking me some questions about the project. But here it does understood it's a mock demonstration. So it's just answering itself following a procedure and then I say yes, that's good. Let's go and it will create it. And so now it will follow the process to create the mock project as defined in the skill. Okay, so it will create project structure generate the cloud. And defile C cloud. And defile what you should have in any project. I read me. And as well then do some other stuff that are defined in the skill. Okay, I will stop there. Okay, if you have created anything, please clean that it was just an example. Okay, sing to and to remember about skills, the progressive disclosure mechanism, the mix of deterministic, script code, which is really reliable and LLM is that is more flexible. And you can mix that inside the skill. If you want to ensure that the skill is used normally, code code auto invoked the skills, but sometimes it might just try to do it on its own, especially if it's simple task you're asking. So if you really want to enforce the skill mentioned the skill, when you ask code code to do something, so definitely skills are super powerful individually. But what if you run multiple skills and some agents at once called that parallel execution? Let's have a look. We already saw a bit how to do this with sub agents or tool calls like when we I show you web search in the previous example. Let's talk a bit more about parallel execution. So the cool stuff in a cloud code is that you can execute in parallel either tool, is there sub agents on sometimes just cloud code sessions. Okay, so the basic two approaches are multiple sub agents in one session. And in this case, cloud code will invoke multiple sub agents simultaneously to do a walkflow. Once again, each agent we get isolated context window, but can share information. Either cloud code give different information to the different sub agent to coordinate them. All you can use also files inside your folder that these agents have access to to refresh their context, share information, share their work, right? The cool stuff is that cloud orchestrate automatically. You cannot do this in chat, GPT, cloud or Gemini or these other AI tools. Cloud code here allows you to do it. The other approach is to use multiple cloud code chat sessions, which we knew open several cloud code windows inside the same folder, all sometimes in different folders and each session were different topic. Here, it's you orchestrate and check the what they do. Something to understand, if you want to orchestrate multiple agents of you want to have cloud code or orchestrating multiple agents, you can do it in parallel. If there are no dependencies, if task A done by agent A doesn't need task base, Bs output, for instance, and if they're working on different files. Okay, you want to avoid having two agents working on the same files at the same time in parallel, because it's messy. So the advantage here obviously is massive time saving with parallel execution. And really the work I see it is on the CEO and I distribute work among my teams. And so that's why most of the time I'm working with multiple department. Here I'm working with my operational team in my business OS. Here I'm working with my HR team GPT Express Messery and here I'm working with my content team. Okay, it's like I'm a CEO with multiple teams, multiple department, and I can distribute work and they can all work in parallel. Okay, I can run some stuff in my with my operational team, then in parallel, I can run stuff with my HR team and then in parallel, I can work on some stuff with my content team. Now, if I check in my content team, actually we have several sessions. So my content team is working on several stuff in parallel. Same here if I check my operational team, I have several sessions in parallel. But when I work with like this, I'm really the CEO with multiple teams, multiple department, I distribute work, they do their stuff in parallel. I check what they're doing, I give them feedback, I give them direction, and that's the way we can really have super high leverage in what we do. I want to insist how powerful it is to have self orchestrated sub agents by Cloud Code and the capability of Cloud Code to invoke tools, to invoke some agents, to invoke skills and for choosing in some agent to invoke them in parallel. So far, we've seen different capabilities that Cloud Code has, but what if you need to connect Cloud Code with external services? For instance, APIs. That's the next one. The cool stuff with Cloud Code is that you can connect your environment with external tools. Okay, so far in the course we've covered internal tools, internal features that Cloud Code has. Now let's talk about external tools. So first, API, don't be afraid, that's really simple. An API is just an interface that allows software to discuss with each other. And usually what you do, if you have an external tool you want to work with, you check if they have an API, and then you check the documentation of this API, you put it inside Cloud Code, you explain what you want to do, and Cloud Code, we figure out how to discuss with this external tool. Because once again, an API is just an interface that allows programs to discuss together. And in an API, you have endpoints which are internet addresses. And when you want to work with an API, you just find the right endpoints, the right internet address you want to use. And then you send authentication, you send a formatted message to this address, and then the tool, external tools does its stuff, and then give you an answer. And that's as simple as that. So typical use case is when you want to connect your Cloud Code with email, like Gmail, Google Doc, or to your CRM, to add data or pool data from your CRM, or post a social media, every social media platform as an API, which is one again, an interface that you can discuss programmatically with. Or if you want to fetch data from a database, you will use the API of the database tool. Okay, you want to work with an external tool, find the API you need. And if I go, for instance, if I take the example of gamma, which is the API, I'm used to create presentation automatically. So you can see in my business, so as I have some files related to gamma API, that's suppose I want to connect to notion, okay, never done that before. But I could ask Cloud Code to, hey, find the documentation of the notion API so that I can create notes in my notion account, and I can pool data for my notion account. Okay, as simple as this. And that code would just make some web research to find the API documentation. Hopefully it won't be too long, set it, so read it. And then once you get remember authentication, then send the information message, then receiving answers and doing your stuff with the answer. So here, basically, what I would need to do is to get my API key from notion, put it in a dot N V5, that is here where I put all my credentials. And then the code will write the script according to what I need to do. Of course, I can make that evolve. And if I just explain in plain English what I want, Cloud Code, knowing the notion API documentation can just translate what I want into. Okay, what are the URL in the notion API we need to work with? What's the format of the data? What's the protocol to authenticate? And then it will manage that and create a script that allows me to do this. Of course, I would test that and so on, but that's as simple as that. According to the API and how they are built and it depends on the external tool, you may take some times to make it work, but basically with Cloud Code, you don't need any coding skill, which means once you know an API you want to work with, once you get API keys or whatever is necessary to authenticate with this API, if you go, you can create a bridge and then you can get this external tool working with your environment. Great. If you see here, it's looking for the right format to discuss with the notion API. I will stop there because actually I'm not using notion for me notion, the distraction that I know that many people are like notions. So that that would be a simple manner to connect notion to your Cloud Code environment. Okay, you can see here authentication, the API basics here, and then it's here it's documenting how to create a page or notes in notion programmatically. We don't care about this. That's the format of the message should post, which means send to the notion API URL to create a page. Okay, that's the type of format that we need to send an example. If you want to retrieve something from notion, we send that to the right endpoint, the right URL, which is database. Can you see here the URL was a page here, it's database, and then of course, database ID, which is the identification of the database you want to call information from. And that's it. And so now here, would you like me to create a complete Python or JavaScript script for a specific use case? I could say yes, I will stop there because once again, I'm not using notion, but just to show you that you don't need to be a coder and the concept is pretty simple. API once again, it's an external interface you can use to to programmatically connect with an external tool. And that is just URLs and you send message to this URL, you get answers. Okay, you send message, which are requests on the URL, the external tool does this, it's stuff based on the message of send. The only thing is that the message need to be properly formatted. The authentication must be properly handled, most of the time with API keys. And then once the tool has done its job, it gives you back to whatever results you needed. And then you can process it inside of Cloud Code very simple. Okay, so advantageous. And we can stop copy pasting between tools and look, we don't need AI workflows. We don't need Zapier, we don't need make dot com. We don't need all that any longer can do it like sign up. The only use case when you need a make dot com or a Zapier or a N10 is when you want a automation to be triggered whenever when you're not even front on to computer and when you not work. If you want background automation, yes, this, this scenarios are used. Why? Because code code works only when your computer is alive and when you're working on your computer. But in my case, I have very few use cases where I need this workflow automations. And most of the time if I need them, it's super simple. Anyways, so when you have an external tool that you're using, be notion, figma, mirror, whatever, your CRM, air table and so on, they all have API and they all have API documentation. And so you can make research with Cloud Code to find the API documentation and make Cloud Code ingest the API documentation and then create whatever bridge you want with this external tools. Okay, that works great. This being said, there is a new protocol that makes working with external tools theoretically easier. And these are MCPs. It's worth having a look at this because it's, it's a very promising standard and might probably be the best way to connect with external tool in the future. It's still in development, so it's not perfect. But let's have a look at this. MCPs are a standardized manner for AI agents to communicate with external tools. It's a protocol that helps your agent understand what are the tools available in the next tunnel app and call these tools properly. In MCPs, you can have also additional stuff like you can have prompts and stuff like this, but let's keep it simple. So think MCPs as a power adapters for different countries, different tools. Cloud Code is the device, the services are countries, all the tools and the MCPs is the standardized adapter. Okay, so that's easy matter to connect Cloud Code or any AI agent to external tools. So there is lots of hype around MCP because MCPs bring official plugins pre-made toolbox for a given external app that your agent immediately understand and can tap into and use, right? That's the theory. Everything being standardized, that means it's easy to develop MCPs and also it's easy for any AI agents or Cloud Code to use an MCPs. It knows the standard, it knows how to identify the tools that are available, it knows how to use the tools and then apply the tools, the external app, right? And normally it's auto-integrated, which means that the code is able to understand what tools it needs, look for the right tools, then use it and that's it. Okay, so you don't even need normally to request for the use of the tool. If any of it's always better to enforce it, to be sure that everything is done fine. Okay, but the reality is that it's a new technology. So there's big hype, but it still needs maturity. I've seen many MCPs popped up with big claims and actually they are crap. Why? Because they are poorly developed, they are not stable, you can install them in an easy matter on some AI agent like in code, but not necessarily in Cloud Code, like that's a mess. And even when you use them, actually they are not necessarily fulfilling the promises. So if I were you, I would only use official MCPs that are supported by the community and that are well-documented and up to date. Obviously for reliability issues, I will be very cautious with open source MCPs. Why? Because you're not the quality of them, you don't know if they are up to date, you don't know if they are well-documented, that's really tricky. Theoretically you can create your own custom MCPs because MCPs is just a protocol that ends up making easier to connect your Cloud Code or your AI agents with external tools. Easier than having to do it manually, understanding the API and creating scripts to make API calls. But at the end of the day, this is packaged API calls, right? Just it helps AI agents to automatically understand what are the tools so that they can invoke them automatically without you doing nothing. And understand immediately what are the set of tools and points that are available and how to use them. So it's really a protocol to make life easier for agents and leverage AI to use external tools properly according to context. That's that's the idea of date, it's a package. This is what it's a communication protocol. So once you use MCP, use MCP when you have a proven official idly MCP for an app. An external tool you want to plug on your Cloud Code or AI agent system. If no MCP exists, I advise you or if you can just find some crappy open source MCPs that are advised you to use API script, the thing we've seen just before. Same if you need custom logic or specific use of external tool, use API scripts. Let me show you how to install MCP and what it looks like. So I like this this this data repo model context protocol, which is what MCP means slash servers. Why because it's an official one? You have lots of MCPs here. Let's pick one will pick playwright, which is a Microsoft MCP. It's a browser automation MCP that's used playwright to run test navigate pages capture screenshots, create content, automate web interaction reliably. So pretty much giving your Cloud Code if you're using Cloud Code access to internet and visualizing web pages and working with web pages. So that's pretty cool, right? So if I click there, I go in this page here and here I have the information about the answer, but since we are not coder, we won't check that. But just here quick quick review here 23k starts. I mean, lots of people are use that and rated here. Here you have the releases like the latest one is this one was released yesterday, which means it's it's an MCP that is actively worked on and updated, right? Many contributors, et cetera. It's a really good indication that the MCPs actually legit. And so if you want to install your MCP in code, you can either ask Cloud Code directly. Hey, I want to use this MCP. Do it. What I like to do is I like to check that there are something in the MCP that is perfect to install in Cloud Code. They have implemented quick installation for Cloud Code. And so here that means if we want to use it in Cloud Code, we just need to use that line here in Cloud Code. So let's go back into Cloud Code here. Okay, we paste it. I can say I will give some context. Hey, I want to install globally the playwright MCP and then validate. And so it will execute the command and that's it. It's installed. It's as easy as that. When you want to install validated MCPs, legit one, it's pretty straightforward. Now I've seen myself struggling a lot with some underground MCPs. And so I don't recommend to spend too much time on that. Okay, so now I have my playwright MCP that has been successfully installed globally. And so it's added to the Cloud configuration. I should find it in this folder if I want to check. Let's keep it simple. And then it can automate web browsers, create dynamic web content, test web application, interact with web page programmatically. This one is really good when you're developing a new one, by the way. And so it's normally available globally. So I will log that. Yes, let's do the three, three steps. By the way, in the meantime, I use the command slash MCP. I can check MCP status and I can see a playwright is connected, whatever. And if I use the MCP manage MCPs, now I'm to continue in the terminal with just no big deal. And so it will open Cloud Code in my terminal, whatever. And now I am MCP. And so you can see here playwright is connected. If I click on it, I can't configure it. Okay, so that's my playwright MCP server. It's connected. And there are 21 tools. Again, you can see this playwright and speed are 21 tools. So let's see what is in there. You can see there are many tools, upload files, field form, install browser specific for in the config, press key, navigate. Basically, all these tools are actions that my agent, my Cloud Code, can do on a web interface to navigate it through the playwright. Okay, so nothing big here just. I wanted to show you how to install a MCP really quite really quick and how to check that everything is running fine and how to check what kind of tool your Cloud Code has access to through this MCP. Okay, so no big deal here. I remove that. Oh, let's clean that properly. We've covered a lot. Now, let me show you how all these pieces fit together in a two a complex system. Let's make a quick recap. So we've seen that with Cloud Code, you have several features and also several capabilities that make it a complete AI powered system, especially in a business context. Once again, Cloud Code has been highly pushed for developers and coding use cases. But actually we are using it for business and it's amazing. In Cloud Code, we have basically all folder structures which represents our different projects or tasks or teams according the way to want to call that. I call that either project of my teams. And we have Cloud.MD file that gives for each project, each team, each folder, instructions, the mechanism way of doing stuff inside the project, which means each time Cloud Code is called, it check the Cloud.MD files and it knows everything about the current work inside this product. So you can consider that as the business brain and the way your business or your business operating system is structured. Then you have your sub agent teams can be available globally or locally at project level. And I consider that as my different department, my teams working from, okay. And they are self-ocrestraint by Cloud Code. And there are many matters to do this, but let's not enter into the details. Then you have tools that you don't necessarily see internal tools. For instance, Cloud Code has tools for to read files, to do web search and so on. Let's not take too much time on this. Let's keep seeing simple. Cloud Code manage when you use the right tools at the right moment without you doing nothing. So it's kind of working the background. Then you have the skills which are reusable workflow that are packaged and they can be shared between your teams of sub agents or even between other users like your teammates or your customers or exactly what I'm doing in CCG. I'm sharing skills, some skills with you guys. And so all that for their structure, Cloud.MD5, some agent teams, skills tools inside Cloud Code. These are internal capabilities. On top of that, you have also the possibility to add external capabilities, external tools through API and MCP. So you could build your own system trying to understand how to use all that and then do trial and errors and so on. But there is so much value to having pre-built system so that you don't build from scratch. You don't spend months of work on just building the stuff. Designing the folder structure, writing the Cloud.MD5s, creating the sub agents, testing them, improving them, removing the one that are not working while. All building skills library, which takes time because each time you're building a skill, you need to test it, you need to improve it. That's work, right? Our setting of integration, testing API connection, testing MCP. And you could do this and spend lots of time doing this. Or you could deploy mine. The entire business OS with folder structure, Cloud.MD5s, mechanism already built in, as well as my content team with the 14 sub agents that I have in magnetic content OS. The strategic console, the AI Gross Engine plugin, which is yours. That would be the AI Gross Engine with its framework, its structure, but apply to your business with the productivity system, with the daily planning, productivity assessment already building, taking your information, what you work on with Cloud Code on a daily basis to give you assessment, a bunch of productivity, to have you also prioritized using the Bruto prioritization framework on the right stuff for your business. Having AI support to be productive and focused, of course, would add also my HR team, the GPT creation team, the GPT Express Master iOS, and skills and scripts library that I developed for myself, only focusing on stuff that are useful for business, of course. You can have access to all this here in the Cloud Code OS. This is what I'm sharing in Cloud Code OS. I'm sharing my systems, my teams, that you can deploy that right away inside your own business and leverage this full system. And of course, you're not alone with just the system. I'm here through implementation calls to help you customize it or make it evolve as you see fit based on your need inside your business. And so that's the power of the Cloud Code OS program. And so this program is definitely the fastest pass for you. If you want to have a fully integrated AI powered business operating system, that helps you work on what matters inside your business, with the right tool, leveraging it in a maximum manner, the latest AI approach. I'm using this system's daily for my own business, which means I update them, I improve them. And of course, all these improvements and updates are transferred to you in the Cloud Code OS. It's not a static product. It's a leaving evolving system that is driven by my conception of the business, which is all about focus, prioritizing the right stuff inside the business, solving the image bottleneck and improving the aspect of the business that I call attract, attract the right customers, convert the right customers, retain them, ensure that they are satisfied with the service, delivering outstanding service and ascendant, like selling them more stuff. I build everything around this, like the right focus and maximizing the attract, convert, retain, ascend, function or dimension of the business. So we'll talk more at the end about this. But first, let me show you how Cloud Code itself operates because understanding this gives you more control. And here, in the next part, I will show you some ways to use Cloud Code in a better manner. So cool stuff to do with Cloud Code is use the plan mode. With the plan mode, you basically ask Cloud Code to think about what you ask it to do and it will write a plan. And also, you can use natural language command like sync hard, sync harder, or food trusting to really push Cloud Code to use more token and sing more about whatever problems you have asked it to solve or whatever task you wanted to do. And so this plan mode is a read-only architect mode to activate it. I will show you, you can use Shift tab or you can click on the right part of the interface. And then Cloud Code will analyze and propose the plan. You read the plan, you approve, for example, for huge task or huge work, I have to do with Cloud Code. I'll always use the plan mode so that I can review its approach, I can correct it. And sometimes I can better understand also how to implement a given task or a given project. And then I approve and then it executes. It writes the to-dos. You've seen that there is a tool that Cloud Code call Alphen, which is to do a list that help it be aligned with what it needs to do and not forget things. And so really the plan mode is super powerful. And I really recommend that you use it each time you're working on a significant project so that you have architect Cloud Code mapping the plan, suggesting the plan, and then you can validate. And it gives you also the blueprint of what will be done and so that you have no surprise when Cloud Code implements. The advantage of it, of course, is safety and control. It's also helping you to better think about a given project or a given thing you want to implement with Cloud Code and that's super useful, right? It's ensure that you have a structured approach. You know, back in the day, we were working with just prompt or even with just custom GPs. We used to say, and that's a prompting technique, proceed step by step, explain to me what you will do first that I can validate and so on. Here it's same idea, but automatically done by Cloud Code in an optimal manner. So let me show you what plan modes look like. Okay, to activate plan mode, you can use here, this, this, this, you can shift to plan mode. You can use shift tab as well, and it would change it. And then I don't have any example here. I'd like to know how I can best explain to CCG member the power of Cloud Code OS program. And what is the value they would get from it and what they would avoid, what's the pain they will avoid by implementing it and what's the huge benefits they will get if they implement it. Can you help me with that? Okay, in here I want to use plan mode so that Cloud Code can think about it, find some resources inside my CCG business OS and give me a plan to explain that to you obviously. So you can see now it's collecting information. Yes, don't ask again. And here the cool stuff is that Cloud Code won't implement anything. If we just collect information, process that and then come up with a plan based on my request. So here it's gathering context and so on. You can see it has find the information about Cloud Code business OS value proposition and now it's compiling findings to clear organized response for me the plan. So now it's the plan following my query here. So Cloud Code business OS complete value proposition framework, the transformation from chat GPT chat session to Cloud Code business OS we have integrated system that knows your entire business persistent memory, strategic partner, automated operations and intelligence. Point point that we'll avoid. Money, where was I friction? Strategic drift, weeks lost on low value work. What should I work on? Caralysis, a decision fatigue daily inconsistent productivity. With no pattern visibility you cannot analyze your work manual tracking hover. Okay, here we automate tracking blocked without knowing what's blocking you hidden dependencies. Huge benefits they will get time freedom, strategic certainty, compounding intelligence, execution clarity, productivity optimization, project continuity, strategic leverage, plus seven integrated workflows. You have the daily operating system. You have the strategic layer, the aggro and shine. You have the infrastructure layer with project cycle, lifecycle workflow, system maintenance, different proof points, implementation path. You can start with the basic feature, then work with the strategic feature and then use the complete system, positioning for CCG members and key messaging by avatar, simple pitch structure, file ready for you for use. Okay, so that's a plan and then I can say yes, would you like me to create a specific deliverable using this framework, including YouTube scripts, sales page copy, workshop, etc. So it's going beyond what I ask, but here I have a plan. It does gather information, process it and then suggest me a plan with the different elements I could use and then hold me about the resources, but possibly implementation. So that's that's a simple example of to use plan mode. Now I can shift back to normal mode or I can just say execute and then it will execute the plan mode is super powerful to plan your work and be sure that local structure you approach and execute it in a sound manner. Now let's talk about configuration control. I will cover here the next part we'll color settings versus instructions. Let's roll here what I want to cover quickly is settings that Jason and clothe that MD file. We have already covered clothe that MD file, but there is another file which is settings that Jason and this is the way it looks like in my CCG business OS. I have a settings that Jason here and actually in the settings that Jason you can set up environment variables. Of course you can use clothe code to do it for you, but just I want to show you what is inside set of set up variables, some specific rules that you want to use at the project level here that can be at the full system level. If you go in your user slash dot clothe subfolder because in there see the very same settings that Jason basically the settings that Jason is in any project you have inside clothe code. Let me show you that in my root folder my system root folder. I have also set in the Jason. There is nothing in there why because I don't work globally. I work only in my CCG business operation in this CCG business operation folder. So here in my settings that Jason my global settings that Jason there is enough. Okay, in addition to variables and specific rules you have also permissions and deny you can for instance I don't want anything from this project to write in my AI grows and giant knowledge base. Okay. Why? Because I want to keep the knowledge base untouched when I'm working actively on operations. So you need to understand it's they add some layer of automation in your clothe code systems. You have a hierarchy of settings that Jason you have the settings dot local that Jason that will work on your local project only for you. That's the one that we'll be taken into a converse. Then if you don't have that one you have the settings that Jason that works at the project level but that can be used by other users as well if they have access to your project and then you have the general one that I showed you before which is this one here in the dot clothe subfolder of the root user folder and this is the settings of Jason that works globally but it's the weakest. That's the one that we've used the last only if there is nothing else in the previous one. Just the thing to understand is that the settings that Jason set machine readable controls in a Jason format that gives to permission model selection hooks environment variables and CPs and so on. Most of the time you don't need to take care about this. And then if you can use it to enforce permission or authorization and so on but really in a business context must likely won't pay too much attention to that but I want to mention it anyways and you have the cloud dot ND files which is human readable so that's good for you to understand also what is done in a given project and that of course is exploited by cloud code also to have context when it's starting a new session inside a project or inside a team or inside a department or inside a folder for me folder on your machine could can correspond to specific project to specific team and workflows or specific department like I called department like in a company you have your department with your teams your sub agents and all that sit inside of folder that can have a cloud dot ND file that gives context and instructions and settings that Jason that can that gives some consideration elements and per per missions they work together you don't need to pay too much attention to the settings that Jason I have spent I mean I've worked hundreds of hours of my code code and I'm barely pay attention to that one the cloud dot ND file is the most important in my opinion from my experience now can you have tools everywhere and tools only for specific projects yes there that's the notion of IRT already covered that a bit when explaining settings that Jason maybe I did a poor job explaining this to you so I hope you're not confused but let's try to clarify this notion okay let's talk about IR keys settings IRT from the IOS to the lowest so that's what I try to explain like few minutes ago you have local project settings in the dot cloud settings dot local dot Jason that's your personal it won't be available for other teammates it won't be available on did have if you have synchronized what you do code with data then you have shared project settings in the dot cloud slash settings that Jason and all all these dot clouds subfolder are available in all folders you're working on with code right it's everywhere and every project or department or teams or workflows you're working on inside a folder on your computer there is a dot cloud subfolder and they have settings that local that Jason must of the time there's nothing in there side note here okay so the two first layers local project shared project you can see the shared project actually it's checked on it on so it can be used by other teammates who have access to the same project if you share the product and then you have the personal global settings in your user folder subfolder dot cloud and finally settings that Jason and that's your preferences the personal everywhere and analogy to understand that is that you can have a personal two bucks and that's what is in the dot clouds subfolder of your route user folder so that's the tools you carry everywhere personally then you have team workshops inside your project in the dot cloud subfolder of a project folder and then you have your personal tweaks which is the settings that local dot Jason okay the setting merge they're not replaced but we've another priority and the higher priority of a rise is specified and from what I've experienced and understood this one for you as more priorities as this one that does more priority this one this logic of hierarchy is true for other object inside the code for agents for instance you can have agents in a specific folder you can have agents in your dot cloud subfolder of your user root folder and if they are just local they are applied to the project only if they are the dot cloud subfolder of the user root folder they apply everywhere same for skill I know that like currently on November 2025 there are some issues about the capacity to invoke skills that are locally implemented what this being said that's a detail it has not prevented me from from from doing but what I wanted to do so it's a detail but I'm mentioning okay key mechanism automatic discovery so when Cloudcos word it scans folders and so you don't have to say anything to Cloudcoated with just can folder and see what is available in the settings dot Jason files and the same with Cloud dot MD files by the way some element like skills are auto activated and once again skills can be in your user folder it can be in the project folder right normally they are automatically invoked by Cloudcoats sometimes I recommend you to enforce the invocation by Cloudcode by mentioning that you wanted to use the skill that is the safe path I would say there is another thing in that I've shown you previously without mentioning too much about this is command when you use the slash key if I go there you have access to command you can see here you can navigate a different command and you have the slash command here okay like compact content formatter and so on to be honest I rarely use the command but this is your way also to trigger specific command manually without relying on Cloudcoated to invoke automatically skills or other stuff like this okay so the difference I see with skills and command is that skills can be auto invoke whereas command it's you ask Cloudcoated to specifically something using a command and I will tell you more about command in a few minutes and so this hierarchy of settings that Jason but also on skills on agents helps you to contain this object on this feature at different level either just for you personally or globally on your system with other people having access to part of your project friends I tried to cover configuration control control this being said most of this I told you that so that you understand and you you know that it exists but really when you're using your system when you're using Cloudcode you don't need to manage that too much especially if you're using it so now if you using with other teammates that's another story now how can you try what Cloudcode does let's talk about logging let's cover logging and tracking so in Cloudcode you have building Cloudcode logging stuff Cloudcode track tool usage it loves error and it keeps session history so if you open a Cloudcode session already showed you that but if I open a if I check this one for instance here you can see I have my session history and I can open one and I really go on with what I did in this given session okay so that means you can reuse sessions so Cloudcode is keeping history and loading stuff but that's not enough why because it's mostly technical stuff or just chat session I've implemented my own custom business logging logic using several mechanism logging different operation in a structure manner and integrating that with different other work for some processes this is not part of Cloudcode by default this is part of Cloudcode OS and this is something you can access to in the Cloudcode OS program okay I'm continuously improving this because what I want to do with the right logging system I want to be able to track the work that has been done to do some analysis over time about the work that is done about alignment of a tigic priorities and many many other stuff for which logging what you do in a structure manner and clever manner is super useful really here we are leveraging if you have the right systems and you will have when you join Cloudcode OS you can really take a nod just step in turn of tracking your work planning your work analyzing your work understanding what happened if there is any DRL or issues and many many other stuff understanding what teams are doing teams or project or work for the encircle code are doing understanding how to improve that doing some improvement analysis do like that tie is the limit this is what you would like to to have in your normal business with your teammates okay except here you don't need them it's automated and it's well-structured and you can process cross cross project cross team across time analysis and so on you have a real business journal optimized for business perspective for business objectives and for business use you can flip back anytime you can track your progress you can analyze patterns like that's so powerful and that's where real business value see with such a system as the Cloudcode OS because now you know exactly what you what Cloudcode has worked on but also what you are your teammates if you put them in the system have worked on you can spot patterns you can check if it's science of workflows you can find bottlenecks you can fly find productivity D rail you can find like many stuff you can do audit trade for compliance you can use use for continuous improvements and the cool stuff is that all this is is done automatically and that's super powerful if I show you an example for instance if I check yesterday I did a productivity assessment so you can see here I can come back to the right transition and that's my productivity assessment and look what it has spotted pattern identified infrastructure building crowds out execution for two consecutive days why because I said business priorities I should have worked on last Saturday and actually I spent sometimes creating what it calls infrastructure which are basically systems instead of working on the business priorities I worked on infrastructure and so it has spotted this because obviously I haven't been able to address some priorities I have I needed to work on and it's analyze why I did that and did some recommendation which is a it's okay to work on infrastructure but do it after you want to after working on the main topics you have planned for the day and it was able to do this because it track everything I do and it understand the strategic environment strategic how to say that priorities and also the different projects I'm working on a different task I'm working on okay can see the power of it that's crazy anyway sometimes you want to trigger specific workflows manually and so that's when you use custom commands it so we have already covered really critical systems commands in the previous chapter but let's take closer look to this you already build commands in code code now already show you this if you type slash you have pre-built commands or all that okay but you can also set up your own commands which are basically work flows on processes simple processes that you can trigger manually so that code code execute them and so what are custom commands are usually initiated multi-step workflows they are stored in once again in a dot-cloth folder in a subfolder that is commands and you can invoke them just using the command name some analogy it's a bit like a macro in excel or short-con on your phone it's just a sequence of preparation that you can trigger anytime and the difference between skills and command because that might be a question you have is that skills are auto invoked by cloud the automatic context based which mean cloud code understand the context and identify the skills that match the context and then we'll use the skills and use progressive disclosure good deeper if necessary take some resources that are inside the skills maybe a script that is inside the skills and execute whereas custom commands it's you invoke manually and trigger explicitly something that cloud code has to do and so typically it's very useful for rickering workflows when sense if you want to do weekly planning you can have a custom command to do this it's also useful for complex sequences when you have multi-step processes to do and when you want to standardize process and trigger them manually full control and so how you can create that commands custom command you use cloud code and you ask for a custom command okay you explain what you want and total we have to create the custom command and basically what code will do it we create a file that is we put in the dot-cloth slash command subfolder once it's done you just call the custom command with the slash and the name of the command okay and if I show you what a custom command looks like let me find one for you in my CCG business operation in my dot-cloth folder I have here a command which is in it business and you can see like skills like sub agents it's a markdown find a dot and defy with a YAML header metadata with a description and this is what this command does it's in your initialize business project cloth dot md with business specific guidance it has some tools it can use red, right, edit, globe which are the basic tools of code code and then just the md file instruct what code should do when I trigger this command in it in it business it's a custom command I have created so that I have cloth code creating a project infrastructure with a cloth dot and defy that is specifically structure for what I want to do so I want cloth code to do something in a specific manner and I want to trigger it manually I use a custom command enough with commands now how about syncing cloth's work with external system dressing right so let's talk about github and how to do backup version control and collaboration so github is really for coder but guess what we are using cloth code not for code we are not developers we are just normal people entrepreneurs who have businesses and want to leverage the power of AI to run our business in a lean effective and focused manner so that we can get free right okay so we I'm using github to for different purpose to backup the work I do inside my business OS of course to control the version to be able to revert back in a more automating manner if need be and also to sometimes collaborate with other people right so what is github quickly it's kind of the drug drug box for code with time travel so you can backup stuff you can control version you can collaborate you can time travel that means you can revert back what you did and there are lots of many other stuff but for all purpose that's the main stuff to understand the main features of github to understand are many other stuff you can do for github it's a very powerful tool for coders but for us it's good enough you can work in parallel in test different approach in parallel to check the ones you prefer and then merge the one you prefer on the main projects and you can do so many stuff whatever the advantage is for business is that you can recover for any issues that's the backup okay which means you can also use your system on another computer if need be why like let's suppose that your computer is that because one of the problems code is that you work on local fire right and what if you have a virus or what is your your your computer is dying now you screwed not any longer as you have a backup system on github because now you can open another computer lock inside your github account import everything inside your new installation and you're good to go you can also control the version history so you can see the system evolution you can collaborate with other people experiments safely you can audit stuff just and who work on what and who change what if you have several people working on the same cloud code business OS and it gives you remote access because you can access from any machine as well and so how it work you ask clot code to create a github repo you can add clot code to github it's something you do once and then if you give access to clot code to the github CLI which is some sort of module clot code is able to create whatever repo in your github account and so that makes stuff way easier and then of course clot code can commit changes which mean push changes on your github repo and and commit them so that now they are alive you can also synchronize between your local clot code business OS and what is inside github you can clot revert collaborate anytime that's super powerful that's really easy to set up you ask clot code and it at some point you ask you to connect to github with your your authentication method you do this you accept connection you accept the synchronization the connection between clot code and github and you're good to go that's really straightforward let me bring it all together because we have covered many things here and let me show you what's next so we have covered a lot we have covered five based memory and system prompt with clot dot and defies you have covered sub agents organize as teams that allows you sequential or parallel execution having the sub agent auto orchestrated by clot code we have covered skills with our usable reusable workflows which are send out operating procedure that you can equip your clot code system with or that you can also equip your teammates using clot code with so that you can enforce SOPs at the company level we have covered parallel execution whereas it is with sub agents operating in parallel or tools that clot code calls in parallel we have covered access to external tools through API integration and MCPs we have covered some feature that makes the work with clot on more effective like plan modes some commands we have covered the difference between settings with settings that Jason files that are more for machine reading and clot dot md instruction well fit for you to understand what happens at the project level and also for clot code to load context when it start a new session in any project we have talked about rrt how you can organize skills agents and settings that Jason files at different levels so that it can be used by only you locally on your machine everybody working on the given project or globally on your system we have covered logging mechanism quickly that is super useful for many business use cases like productivity assessment planning strategic alignment checking and many other stuff we have covered custom commands quickly how you can set up small automation or specific workflows that you can trigger manually which is a bit different from skills where skills skills are triggered automatically invoked automatically by clot code custom commands helps you standardized some stuff you do and trigger them manually and then we have covered backup and version control using GitHub in a very quick manner so you can see that when you understand all these features you have a complete system but actually that's just step one knowing the features understanding how they work and where you can access them it's only step one step two it's implementing a cohesive system that combine all these feature in a smart manner for a business context in order to increase business efficacy in order to increase focus on what matters inside the business and in order to increase the power of execution your business leveraging AI powered system the best manner of course you can make your own trial and error and spend weeks maybe months to try to set up the system all you can use a pre-made one and that's exactly what I give you in clot code OS inside CCG community in the clot code OS you have the entire business OS that's the one I use for myself so you can be sure that it's stop not and I make it better consistently when you have my business OS you have the folder structure that is directly applicable to your business you have the clot dot MD files which has the system prompts and a smart logic for the different folder and different project you have already integrated mechanism for productivity for planning for cross-project analysis and so on you have also my own teams my department you have my content team with the magnetic content OS that has more than 14 sub agents to work on any type of content on LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, etc. working on hooks working on some days working on all that stuff related to content and a content framework that I teach also in CCG you have what I call my strategic console which is the a agros and giant plugin with all the frameworks to really distract in the strategic manner you offer your target of the tar your strategy your funnels your different products and so on you have my productivity system with the daily planning with the productivity assessment with the logging systems to log the different projects to log the different tasks to log the different change that you do with clot code inside your business environment you have of course my HR department what I call my HR department which is the GPT creation team the GPT XFMastery OS that's used my GPT XFMastery framework to craft custom GPT but also some agents but at a superior level why better than what you would do with just clot code or just clot or just a chat GPT why because it's using a method that I've experimented with for more than two years and I've I told too many people who just can tell you that it's a crazy good framers to craft superior custom GPT's an AI agent but there is more you will also access to essential skills like the skills factory for instance the skills to be other crazy good skills and other skills that I developed based on business use and business needs you also have some scripts library to connect with external tools and you just need to put your own API keys and you're good to go and that would be much more because once again this is the AI part business system to grow lean GPT business a business that is optimized with lean processes to focus really on what matters to grow the business implementing the best approaches to attract convert retain as and customers without having to spend months to learn them that would be much more I will update this based on how I use the system and how other members in the clot code are using the system to get results and also based on the new stuff that anthropic will release for clot code because guess what clot code is a big bad that anthropic made this is a tool they are investing investing massively to make better and there are so much great stuff that will come the future and that will be updated inside clot code OS here the key difference is that you're not building anything from scratch you can just take the resources I share with you these are folders basically that you put on your computer and you good to go you put clot code in your visual studio code interface and you go in the right folder and good to go everything is there already set up right so you can deploy in minutes what I've built tested and refined for days weeks months if you're joined the code code OS program you have my support through implementation group calls that we do and also you have access to me through the M and so we can discuss about your specific case and I can help you tweak a bit the pre-made system that already there and that you can deploy in minutes a leaving system I updated constantly and my updates are directly implementing in clot code OS so that you can benefit from them and of course you may have some specific requests and if they are make sense I can implement them as well which mean here we are leveraging clot code OS we are leveraging collective intelligence to make our business OS better with time so finally if your business owners whereas you have an online business where are you your coach your service provider you you do consulting all you need to create content are you do product development this is for you if you want an AI team to end up execution inside your business so I can focus on strategy and you can just orchestrate your teams your department as a CEO that's for you because this code code OS is the business operating system that you can use right away to have these teams working for you and you can treat it also with the support inside the community and so if you want proven systems that are ready to deploy it immediately you can learn more about this in CCG my community and here in clot code OS this is the module where everything happens and where the resources to have your own AI powered business OS inside clot code are sitting waiting for you so I hope you enjoy this clot code mastery for business course and I see you inside CCG
