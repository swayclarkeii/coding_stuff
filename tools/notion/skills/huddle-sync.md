# Slack Huddle to Notion Sync

## Purpose
Synchronize Slack huddle meeting notes to the Notion Meetings database. This skill:
- Creates new Notion pages for each huddle
- Updates existing pages with latest notes content
- Automatically maps Slack users to Notion users (by email)
- Preserves formatting, links, and emojis

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Sync huddles to Notion"
- "Update the huddle pages"
- "Import Slack huddles"
- "Sync meeting notes from Slack"

## Commands

### Sync New Huddles
Creates NEW Notion pages for all huddles from Slack:
```bash
./run tool/huddle_sync.py sync
```

### Update Existing Huddles
Updates EXISTING Notion pages with latest notes content:
```bash
./run tool/huddle_sync.py update
```

### Refresh Mappings Cache
Rebuilds user/channel mappings from Slack and Notion:
```bash
./run tool/huddle_sync.py refresh
```

### Check Status
Shows cache status and mapped users:
```bash
./run tool/huddle_sync.py status
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Discovery
On first run (or when cache is stale), the tool automatically:
1. Fetches all Slack users and Notion users
2. Matches them by email address
3. Gets all Slack channel names
4. Finds the "Meetings" database in Notion
5. Caches everything to `~/.config/cc-plugins/cache/huddle_mappings.json`

### Cache Management
- Cache auto-refreshes after 7 days
- New users are added when discovered
- Run `refresh` to manually rebuild mappings

## What Gets Synced

### Properties
| Slack Field | Notion Property |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Channel + date | **Name** (title) - e.g., "#dev-main Huddle - 2025-12-21" |
| `date_start` | **Date** |
| `duration_seconds` | **Duration** (minutes) |
| `participant_history` | **Team Attendees** (mapped to Notion users) |
| Notes permalink | **External URL** (links to Slack notes doc) |
| — | **Status** = "Completed" |
| — | **Type** = "Huddle" |
| — | **Source** = "Slack" |

### Page Content
- Huddle notes converted from HTML to Markdown
- Headings, lists, bold/italic preserved
- Links are clickable
- Slack emoji codes converted to actual emojis

## Requirements

Both plugins must be installed and configured:
- `slack` plugin with `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_USER_TOKEN`
- `notion` plugin with `NOTION_API_KEY`

The Notion integration must have access to:
- Your Meetings database
- User information (to map attendees)

## Troubleshooting

### "Meetings database not found"
The tool searches Notion for a database with "Meetings" in the name. Either:
- Ensure your database is named "Meetings" (or contains that word)
- Share the database with your Notion integration

### User not mapped
Users are matched by email. If a user isn't mapped:
1. Ensure their Slack and Notion accounts use the same email
2. Run `./run tool/huddle_sync.py refresh` to rebuild mappings

### "Could not find slack plugin"
Both `slack` and `notion` plugins must be installed:
```bash
/plugin install slack@cc-plugins
/plugin install notion@cc-plugins
```
