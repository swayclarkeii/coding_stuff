 Hi, my name is J.L. Breyer. I'm the founder and CEO of Focus AI. I'm a professional engineer with a master degree in business administration and 20 plus years of experience managing complex projects in high process industries. Your leadership brought me in to identify opportunities where AI and process improvements can save you time. This video explains what to expect from our interviews and what it's not about. Let's dive in. Focus AI is an AI agency that does two things. AI audits and AI solutions implementation. We assess your workflows, identify bottlenecks, calculate ROI, then help you implement solutions that sticks. Right now, we're in the AI audit phase. So let's focus on what that means for you. An AI audit is a systematic assessment of how your company currently works. We map workflows, document tasks, measure time and effort, and identify pain points. It's like doing a building inspection before renovations. We want to understand what's actually happening, not what should be happening. The goal is to find the hidden time syncs, like repetitive and manual tasks that are stealing hours from your week. And we use interviews to determine all that. Here's how interviews work. Before we meet, you might have completed a pre-interview questionnaire that gave us a starting point. During interviews, we're clarifying vague areas and diving into details. We'll ask you to walk through your day and show us actual workflows. Here's what's critical. We need to quantify time. Not client reporting takes a while. We need something like I spend four hours per client pulling data from five different platforms. We'll ask, how long does this task take? How often do you do it? What's the time breakdown? What platforms are you using? Your best estimates help us calculate real return on investment. Be prepared to share your screen if needed. Walking us through a specific task or system helps us understand the actual process. Not just a theory. We interview both managers and users. Why? Managers see strategy. And users see where friction lives. We need feedback from both. These aren't performance reviews. This is discovery. Honestly, about what's broken leads to better solutions. To ensure accuracy, these calls will be recorded for note-taking and documentation purposes only. Your individual input is completely confidential. We use your feedback in combined and anonymized form to inform process optimization and technology strategy. Never to evaluate individual performance. Think of it like a doctor patient conversation. Documented for accuracy, protected for privacy. Okay, so what these interviews are not about? They're not about replacing jobs. The goal is saving you hours per week for higher value work. It's not a blame game. The efficient processes are system problems, not people problems. And it's not for forcing change. Recommendations must make financial sense and actually improve your work. And what this audit is about? It's saving you time. So you can reclaim hours for meaningful work. It's reducing frustration, having better systems, less manual labor. It's making operations smoother, better work-life balance, clearer processes, and it's better tools. Like AI, automation, or just fixing broken workflows. And what we would appreciate from you is plain honesty. What are the work-arounds, the bottlenecks? And those processes where you always done it this way. If you can share your time estimates, how long tasks actually take, not the simplified versions. Like for example, show us the real workflows, not the sanitized version. If you could screen share when helpful, because seeing the actual process beats description every time. Your honest feedback makes this extremely valuable. Alright, so bottom line, this is about making your job easier. Giving your time back. Fixing what's broken, not blaming who's doing it. If you have any questions, you can either reach out to me at the email below or to your manager. Otherwise, I'm really excited to work with you. Let's find some wins together. See you soon.
