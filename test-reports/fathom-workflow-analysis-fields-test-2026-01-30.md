### Merge Search Data Output (After Merge)

The Merge Search Data node successfully combined data from:
- Parse AI Response (analysis fields)
- Parse Performance Response (performance metrics)

**However**, when checking the Merge Search Data output, the 8 analysis fields were NOT visible in the merged output shown.

**What WAS visible in Merge Search Data:**
- Performance fields (perf_performance_score, perf_improvement_areas, etc.)
- Meeting metadata (meeting_title, meeting_date, contact_name, etc.)
- Matched contact/client data

**What was MISSING:**
- summary
- pain_points
- quick_wins
- action_items
- key_insights
- pricing_strategy
- client_journey_map
- requirements

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Merge Search Data Node Not Pulling Parse AI Response Fields

**Problem:** The Merge Search Data node was fixed to pull from BOTH Parse AI Response and Parse Performance Response, but when examining the actual merged output, the analysis fields (summary, pain_points, etc.) are NOT present.

**Hypothesis:** The Merge Search Data code may be:
- Only extracting specific fields instead of merging all fields
- Overwriting Parse AI Response fields with Parse Performance Response fields
- Not preserving the analysis fields in the merge logic

### Issue 2: Prepare Airtable Data Not Mapping Analysis Fields

**Problem:** Even if Merge Search Data had the fields, Prepare Airtable Data is not configured to map them to Airtable columns.

**Evidence:** Current Prepare Airtable Data output only includes 9 fields, none of which are the 8 analysis fields.

## Required Fixes

### Fix 1: Update Merge Search Data Code

**Current behavior:** Not preserving analysis fields from Parse AI Response

**Required change:** Ensure Merge Search Data includes ALL fields from Parse AI Response in the merged output:
- summary
- pain_points
- quick_wins
- action_items
- key_insights
- pricing_strategy
- client_journey_map
- requirements

### Fix 2: Update Prepare Airtable Data Code

**Current behavior:** Only mapping 9 fields (basic metadata + performance fields)

**Required change:** Add mappings for the 8 analysis fields to Airtable output:
```javascript
{
  // ... existing mappings ...
  "Summary": mergedItem.summary || "",
  "Pain Points": mergedItem.pain_points || "",
  "Quick Wins": mergedItem.quick_wins || "",
  "Action Items": mergedItem.action_items || "",
  "Key Insights": mergedItem.key_insights || "",
  "Pricing Strategy": mergedItem.pricing_strategy || "",
  "Client Journey Map": mergedItem.client_journey_map || "",
  "Requirements": mergedItem.requirements || ""
}
```

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action:** Fix Merge Search Data to preserve Parse AI Response fields
2. **Secondary Action:** Update Prepare Airtable Data to map the 8 analysis fields
3. **Validation:** Re-run test execution after fixes to confirm all 8 fields appear in Airtable output
4. **AI Prompt Enhancement:** Consider improving AI prompts to generate pricing_strategy and client_journey_map (currently empty)

---

## Test Data Used

```json
{
  "test": true,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-30T18:30:00+01:00"
}
```

Note: Workflow used default test data in Process Webhook Meeting node when test flag is true.

---

## Conclusion

**Workflow Status:** ✅ Executes successfully without errors

**Field Generation:** ⚠️ Partial (6/8 fields generated by AI, 2 empty)

**Field Mapping:** ❌ Failed (0/8 fields mapped to Airtable output)

**Next Steps:** Fix Merge Search Data and Prepare Airtable Data nodes to preserve and map the 8 analysis fields.
