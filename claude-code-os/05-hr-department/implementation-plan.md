# HR Department - Implementation Plan

## Department Purpose
AI agent creation and management. This is your "agent factory" - where you build custom AI assistants for your specific workflows.

## Status: LOCKED
**Unlock when:** You find yourself doing repetitive tasks that could be automated with custom agents.

**For Sway:** After delivering 2-3 projects, you'll see patterns. That's when you build agents to automate YOUR delivery process.

## What This Department Will Do

### Agent Creation Framework
The GPT Express Mastery methodology for rapidly building effective AI agents:

1. **Define** - What does the agent need to do?
2. **Research** - What knowledge does it need?
3. **Optimize** - What's the most efficient workflow?
4. **Engineer** - Write the system prompt
5. **Test** - Iterate until it works reliably

### Agent Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Client Delivery | Project scoper, requirements gatherer, QA checker |
| Sales | Proposal writer, follow-up drafter, objection handler |
| Operations | Meeting summarizer, task extractor, status reporter |
| Content | Script writer, post generator, idea generator |

## Planned Factory Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Purpose Refiner | Clarify what an agent should do |
| Knowledge Researcher | Gather info the agent needs |
| Process Optimizer | Design the agent's workflow |
| Prompt Architect | Write effective system prompts |

## Why Wait?

Building agents too early = solving problems you don't have yet.

Wait until you notice:
- "I keep doing this same thing over and over"
- "I wish I had help with [X]"
- "This part of my process is slow/painful"

Then you'll build agents that solve REAL problems.
