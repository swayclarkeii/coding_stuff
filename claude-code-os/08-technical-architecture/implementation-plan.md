# Technical Architecture - Implementation Plan

## Department Purpose
System design, integration specifications, and technical infrastructure for Oloxa.ai.

## Status: LOCKED
**Unlock when:** You're building complex multi-system solutions or need to formalize your technical stack.

**For Sway:** This becomes relevant when you're delivering sophisticated solutions or want to document your technical approach.

---

## What This Department Will Do

### Technical Documentation
- System architecture diagrams
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Database schemas

### Development Standards
- Code conventions
- Testing requirements
- Deployment processes
- Version control practices

### Tool Stack
- Primary tools used
- Integration patterns
- Automation platforms
- Development environments

---

## Current Oloxa.ai Tech Stack (Initial)

### Development
- **IDE:** Cursor with Claude Code
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript (as needed)

### Automation
- **Workflow Automation:** n8n (likely)
- **AI:** Claude API, OpenAI API
- **Integrations:** Various client-specific

### Business
- **Communication:** Email, video calls
- **Documentation:** Markdown files, Google Docs
- **Planning:** Claude Code OS

## Why Wait?

You don't need formal technical architecture when:
- You're building one-off solutions
- Projects are small/simple
- You're still learning what works

You need it when:
- Solutions involve multiple integrated systems
- You want to reuse patterns across clients
- You're onboarding developers or contractors
- Clients need technical documentation

---

## When You're Ready

When you find yourself:
- Building similar integrations repeatedly
- Needing to explain your technical approach
- Wanting to standardize how you build

Tell Claude:
"Help me document my technical architecture for the types of solutions I build at Oloxa.ai."

## Future Considerations

### Scaling Technical Capability
- When to bring in developers
- How to specify requirements clearly
- Managing technical debt
- Choosing build vs buy

### Client Technical Requirements
- Discovery questions for technical needs
- Integration assessment framework
- Security and compliance considerations
- Maintenance and support plans
