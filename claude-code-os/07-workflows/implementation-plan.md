# Workflows Department - Implementation Plan

## Department Purpose
Automated routines for daily, weekly, and monthly processes. Turn proven routines into repeatable systems.

## Status: LOCKED
**Unlock when:** You've done something manually 10+ times and it's worth automating.

**For Sway:** After 2-3 weeks of consistent daily/weekly planning, you'll know what works. Then automate it.

## What This Department Will Do

### Daily Workflows
- Morning startup routine
- End-of-day shutdown
- Client communication cadence

### Weekly Workflows
- Week planning process
- Client check-ins
- Progress reviews

### Monthly Workflows
- Monthly review process
- Invoice/billing
- Pipeline review

### Project Workflows
- New client onboarding
- Project kickoff
- Delivery and handoff
- Feedback collection

---

## Why Wait?

**Don't automate what you haven't validated.**

Automating too early means:
- Automating the wrong things
- Missing improvements
- Rigid systems that don't fit reality

Wait until:
- You've done it 10+ times manually
- You know exactly how it should work
- The process is proven effective
