So basically I download the bank statement from last month, so I have everything that comes in, everything that goes out.
And then basically I need to use these seats for everything.
Yeah.
And so then I, for example, go for invoices, I go here, I see, on this stage, I had an invoice from Greenbox.
So I go here, I check Greenbox, I see a K, January 6th, yeah, it's the correct invoice.
Okay, so you get your statement, you have your statement here.
Yeah.
And then you're like transaction.
Yeah.
Let me go find that invoice.
Exactly.
And then I download it.
Mm-hmm.
And then I file it like here.
For example, Greenbox would be here, and then everything is file here, like with the date.
With the date, the name.
And then you don't have to rename it.
You use their dating.
You use their date's naming system?
Mm-hmm.
So I basically download whatever, like the PDF comes downloaded.
Yeah.
And just at the date in front, and then the name, and then whatever says behind the stage.
Okay.
So you rename it.
Yeah, you rename it here.
Okay.
So because then it makes sense in my...
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
And then I just send it because then I can go in and have a look, for example, 2025.
Like this is all from January to December.
Mm-hmm.
And the ones that are recurring have like set the folders, for example, Google's recurring, Greenbox,
might speak, make sure all these are recurring stuff.
And then I have to go.
This is all local, right?
I'll enter your local hard drive.
Yeah, this one.
If you don't do it in like Google or like Microsoft Prime.
Anything against it?
I'm curious.
Or do you just like to keep...
Is it a security thing for you?
No, no.
No, no, no.
It's not a cool thing.
Yeah.
But...
I don't know.
It's like always a bit finicky.
Sometimes it's like...
Yeah.
Like I had to do a little drive folder on my desktop, for them to put stuff in there.
And then it wouldn't properly upload.
And then I wouldn't have it in my drive.
And then sometimes I put something in the drive.
Directly show up in a theater here.
What do you think?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And then I have to go here.
Yeah, here.
And then I go to the neighborhood line, which means like upload receipts.
And then it's just drag and drag and drop.
Every receipt?
Yeah.
I mean I can also...
I can also...
Like all of them like this.
Okay.
And then batch all of them.
But sometimes it has issues with that.
So literally I go through...
I have...
I have the thing printed out the bank page.
So I look it up.
I download the receipt, name it, pull it over, press upload, etc.
See that again?
So I print out the bank statement.
Yeah.
Like on a piece of paper.
Yeah.
Okay.
I do like two pages on one.
And then usually it's like eight to ten pages.
And I see what I mean.
I download it.
I finally do my system.
I print it.
I press upload.
And then I mark it up.
Ah, okay.
Okay.
And then if I can't find a receipt, I like don't mark it up.
And I keep the stack.
So I can go back and check it later.
And how much time does that take?
I mean eight to ten pages.
I mean not all of it is receipts, but...
So with the online receipts, it's easier.
It takes you like two hours.
It's nice.
But with the physical receipts, it's really annoying.
Because I have to...
I have to scan each single receipt.
Take a photo of it.
And then upload it.
And it's in the past.
I did like...
Like here, I think.
I did like...
I bundled them all in one file.
And then they were like, you know, I didn't take...
As soon as you said it, I was like, they're not going to take it.
And then, yeah, I have to like...
I have to like do every single receipt.
I have like physical, I have to scan.
And obviously I want to date it so I can...
We find it easy for me.
So then this is the really annoying part.
So you're literally just taking a picture with your phone, like your iPhone.
No, I scan it.
I have a printer I can scan it.
So you put one at a time.
True.
One at a time.
True.
One at a time.
Press scan.
Press scan.
How long does that take?
This takes a lot.
This I'd probably do every three months.
With the receipts.
Yeah.
You take these...
The actual receipts.
The physical receipts.
Because I'm too lazy to do it every month.
I'm like postponing them for these three months.
I have a big bash.
I just sit down and spend four hours.
So you do the two hours every...
The online ones, every month?
Yeah.
That's kind of like the first quick dependent one.
Yeah.
Like most months it's really quick.
It's like one and a half to two hours.
And then...
Very seldom.
There's like some websites that send you directly the...
The anyone that has to buy them to wait to get back to you.
It kind of like makes it a bit more of a new sheet.
And all of them come to your email.
Yeah.
I'm assuming.
Yeah.
And then some stuff like, I don't know.
It's like a Spotify.
They don't set it to your email.
You got to go in and log in and get it.
Spotify, Alba, Metro.
Some of these don't send it then I have to go on their website.
Telecom.
They don't have to go to the website.
They go to website log in and then get that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So those ones are quite annoying.
And the other ones just go to your email address.
Yeah.
Which is your company email address, whatever that email address you have.
Just my gay.
Okay.
That's interesting.
And so what do you...
When you scan...
I mean it's interesting when you scan it because I use...
Have you heard of Expensify?
You know...
The reason why I use it is because you can actually use it any...
You can scan it anytime.
Yeah.
So you...
On the road...
You can scan it.
What it does is it...
It will log everything for you monthly.
And then say at the end of the month all you have to do is go in.
You can just go in.
I mean depending on what account you have a free account or you know they have plus plans.
But on the free account you can go in every month and basically select.
It'll tell you like you go in and say October 1st to October 31st.
Then it'll show you all the receipts.
Then you just click all of them.
And you can put this into a...
What do they call it in there?
Like a submission or something.
And then you email that to yourself.
And now you get an email of like all...
Like tablet, like all your receipts for that month.
And individual pictures of all of their scans.
And so it cost me like 499 a month or something like this.
It's not that bad.
And it's like through Apple.
And this saved me a shitload of time.
Because I can even take it while I at the restaurant.
Whatever.
And before I forget, before I lose it, I take that.
Okay, that's interesting.
But even when you take a picture of it, you need the original file, right?
The original file, yeah.
I mean you got to keep this for like your tenure.
Like that's your...
That's your personal problem.
I mean I keep mine.
I mean I just keep mine.
You shoot books for every year.
Yeah, exactly, right.
And so what can you do with your business so I haven't seen anything like this.
Well, the thing that it saves the thing, the scanning thing saves time.
And it saves me.
What I can look into is how it...
What you would be interested in that now is like from this...
From this batch, like okay, you've got all these individual images.
Now you've got to get it into doubt it, right?
So the question would be, how would you get this in doubt it?
That would be my question.
Let me go back and look at it.
Because I can look at it and see how it's structured.
It's usually a PDF.
Actually, I might be able to look at it now.
You probably have an API, don't you?
No.
I mean, they do, but you have to pay for the next step up.
I mean, they even has an API.
That's it.
See, so this is what it prints out for me.
Every month it looks like this.
It gives me my print.
So I can, I don't know if I want to use this.
And then it gives me all the receipts like this.
And then it gives me them individually.
And so my question would be, from this format,
is it helpful for you to get it into doubt it?
Is that even quicker?
Right?
That would be my, that would be my first question.
The next thing I would look at is like...
The next thing would be...
Do you upload this into doubt it?
I don't use doubt it.
I put all of my into a folder system.
And then I give that to my accountant and she does it.
Okay.
She does everything.
So I, but I know people that use the doubt it.
She's okay with...
She takes this.
I just sent her that document.
She's like, okay, perfect.
So I think what I'm also thinking in my head is like...
The ideal situation for you is that you don't have to look for your computer
to find these even for these two hours a month.
And you don't have to go through and rename all of these scanning files.
Because this is digging up a lot of your time.
Going into doubt it is always a tricky one.
Because they have like APIs.
But it's only a certain...
I think it's a certain level.
Like whatever account you have with them.
Or if I like wanted to build a dedicated like...
The program or something that does this for example,
then I would have to pay for some kind of...
Redential for this or something.
So I think that does a bit trickier.
But the time saved could be on your preparation.
Which is what I'm looking to do.
I'm looking to just...
I don't want to...
You know what I mean?
And so one of the options for your images...
Which is what they do.
Which is what this program will do.
But it gives it to you in a particular format.
Is that it just scans it for you.
And then names...
Well, what it doesn't do, it doesn't name your actual file.
And that's where you also would save time.
For example, if you could...
If you could like...
Have all of your images, have all of your photos.
And then they were on your drive.
And then something could go through and look at the photos.
And then rename it.
You know what I'm saying?
This is where you could kind of save time.
Basically it's just like...
Understanding who's it from.
And then this date is where I need...
Who's it?
Ah, the brand.
Who's it from?
The date and the amount.
The amount is not even important for the name of the document.
Ah, you just need the company and the date.
Ah, okay, that's interesting.
That's quite interesting.
And it goes...
Just for naming the file, right?
And it goes two of these for the same date.
And just call one...
One or the other two.
The version one and two.
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, if you had like...
Let's say I went twice at the end on the same day.
I have two different receipts.
But they would have the same file name.
But then it's like one and two.
Yeah, yeah.
It's interesting.
And so that's pretty much the whole flow.
Two hours a month for that.
And then you have your big data dump.
And that would do this problem monthly.
It probably...
You know, one and two and a half hours at a time.
Of that.
Yeah, just like this.
But since I've collected two points and weights...
So that is like...
Do I have to do it?
Like it's usually funny.
Yeah.
It's like scanning.
It takes like...
And then it's like probably 50 seconds or 20 seconds and then it's done.
I take it out, put it in the box, put it in the next one again.
That's why I think this would say...
This program was saving time.
I literally would be like...
Put a receipt down.
Put a receipt down.
And then it does the observation in the background.
Yeah.
I don't need to wait for it to be done.
I can turn off the app.
Then it'll just tell me which ones didn't come through.
Maybe I can re-scan it or something.
Or you can go in and just fill it out.
Okay, that one doesn't have that.
You know what I mean?
You've saved me shit all the time.
You just mind taking pictures.
And you're not going to just scan it for so long.
Yeah, I know.
Especially if I can move on the track.
But then I can just do it.
And then it's there.
Yeah, that's like...
I don't even mind naming the colors.
Because it's quick.
It's literally...
Oh, well, maybe something's that.
Try this program, if you want.
I mean, literally.
I think it's even for 99 USD.
I don't know if you know you're on my show.
But that made me like really save your problem.
And if it does, then great.
But I think I'm also...
I was curious to see your process.
You know, it's just like...
I know they have this for companies.
But it's just...
It's not businesses.
It's like, yo, who wants to do this shit, right?
And I mean, essentially, you're talking about six or...
potentially six...
five or six hours a month of your time.
We should probably be doing...
something else.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's not that.
I mean, if you hear some...
which...
reads this...
and then makes the device really great home.
Yeah.
And they have...
I do something that checks events.
Everything is kind of new.
I mean, they're just going out.
And then...
tries to find the receipt for it.
Yeah.
I mean, it was stuff coming in.
Like, if it's not from...
from live speed, which is, you know, our US system.
We're going to receive it.
Because, again, the months...
I just send that...
the months is somewhere from live speed.
So, to the account of everything.
For example, it's kind of like...
somebody water it.
$20 per person, probably.
Like, I write the invoice, right?
I send it to them.
They transfer the money.
And then they come and say, well,
no proof for this.
I'm...
It's also something...
This is also kind of small.
Because the invoice is very good.
Oh, yeah, that's it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But your invoices are also on your...
you put all your invoices instead of placing it on.
So, it would...
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You've just got to go to that folder every month and say,
okay, here are my invoices.
So, it's more your outgoing expenses.
I mean, your income is tracked by live speed.
Yeah.
I mean, it's a private party.
Exactly.
Which is not...
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, it's your outgoing expenses video.
Like, do an office.
That's what I should for.
Okay.
And then some of that.
Like, all the taxes.
Also, I don't need to track it.
Because they come in already.
As insurance fees, it's also fine.
I don't need to know about those.
Like, even electricity, girls.
I just have to upload the things in the beginning,
like, the calculation that they made for me.
And then that's one for income.
And then we can upload every month.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ah.
Yeah.
Oh you.
Good.
Yeah.
Aessia
über
Ahhh
Thomas Mullen was like the first
I'm serious he was scared
and I have to go and get around
okay the scan from Haibon
to this day
C
but what would be areas before that day
And now they say, oh, OK, you were the information of the order from Davidino's, OK, it must have been published.
This is a kind of an outlier situation, but this is a situation where it sounds like, because you don't have a name, you would have to be able to track it by something else.
So if there were, for example, if you had a statement, if you had from your statement at 29 euros, and then you went and looked for a matching name, and it knew there is no name, there is nothing here, then it would have to look based on something else.
Based on that look for date, in a timeframe, or look for a mount, and look for a mount, and then it could look and say, OK, we downloaded all the invoices.
This is where it would connect to a mount. That's a message to hear. Or what didn't even better way to do it.
And this is kind of what I'm thinking about is basically logging, like having all my mistakes downloaded, and then putting it into a database, and then having all of my bank statements, and putting it into a database, and then cross referencing it, and then seeing what's outlined.
And then I would know, OK, this one, and then I could flag like, hey, what's the invoice for this?
Right, and so it kind of reduces this back and forth searching.
OK, we didn't come in, where do we search? Just log everything, log everything in any kind of matchup.
But you were going to say something.
For example, this is the account of the list. There will be a broad deal of business.
But the company is, hey, a coffee.
So for example, here I was confused. I was like, who is this person? 20, 80, 83, and this name that I, and I didn't order it.
I looked everywhere, and then I figured out it was a coffee order.
It's just because they need their bank accounts.
So your bank statement showed this player William, and you were like, who the fuck is William?
OK, OK, OK, OK. But I'm going to try to think what the connection was.
They ordered it through this company.
There is a runoff order from Payal Coffee, and I ordered beans from Payal Coffee, which I put in the list for the account or whatever.
I just saw my bank account statement.
But you had the invoice, but you didn't know how to connect it.
I think it was my email somewhere.
I think she even forwarded to me saying, hey, this is Payal's invoice.
But I didn't open it. I didn't look at it. I just did a different name for the account.
I guess that's why I could be interesting because if an attachment was downloaded,
if this attachment was downloaded from your email and opened and scanned,
then it would have said, that's player William.
Then it would have said, on your bank account, you have a statement from player William.
You know what I'm saying?
So you wouldn't have to... I'm just thinking about this now.
Because also, the Payal Coffee doesn't even say, company Payal Coffee, just down here,
contact Payal Coffee.
Taxes.
Otherwise, you wouldn't even know that it's Payal Coffee.
Maybe it's the logo, I don't know.
So this, just on totally aside, you're getting coffee from where is this?
Poland.
Really good coffee.
And they roasted it already?
Yeah, they roasted it.
It's very good.
They're really, really good.
I don't know where Luna gets them all from.
She has a really good idea about all these coffee beans and suppliers from Europe.
And then...
So we have full grip in the room.
Last time I missed this one.
Really good?
Yeah, it's really nice.
I can give you something to try if you want.
Yeah, sure.
They have really nice...
They change the box every time.
Then brew a new batch.
Wow.
They get like different designers, like local designers to design it.
And...
Yeah.
Okay, again.
Like, everything...
Everything...
Something looks different.
Like, where is it?
She has it in the hand now.
And...
And...
It's very, very floral.
Almost tastes almost like tea, but it's super nice.
Interesting.
Yeah?
Okay, there.
I see it.
I like the design.
And despite it being more 10 years more expensive than what we usually sell, it sells quite well.
I think it's nice to people.
Yeah.
Okay.
And...
In the summer they have like...
Ice coffee already bottled in cans.
Which we're going to get.
And we'll tell you as well.
It's a cool brand.
Are they doing...
You're going to get a fridge?
Do you have fridge?
Yeah, we have one down there.
Down there.
Ah, but...
So that people could see it, man.
We usually have like one can out.
Okay, okay.
I'm counting that.
So many eyes that you'd grab before the bottom.
Okay, okay.
Okay, cool, man.
I mean, unless there's anything else that you would think is from this nutty fucking accounting to A,
this stuff is so annoying.
It's just a waste of time.
It is.
It's a really bug of a waste of time.
It is.
Okay.
Please.
Let me check it out.
And...
If you don't know if you should be emailing questions or comments.
Okay.
I don't think I have your email.
I don't think I've ever had it.
I'm sure you can just email me directly.
It's email.
Sway.
SW-A-W-A-A-T.
O-L-O-X-A.
O-L-O-X-A.
O-L-O-X-A.
O-L-O-X-A.
O-L-O-X-A.
O-L-O-X-A.
You made a use.
That's a little help.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
Nice.
Okay.
All right, bro.
Let's see, uh, keep in touch and see what comes in.
But check out the really check out this app.
You try for a month.
Let me, I'd be curious to see if it could help you out.
Trying to say a cost on all of them.
But for my name is okay,
but for example, I haven't still got the money, uh,
a shift, a shift housing tool.
Like we do, we do everything in real sheets like this.
Dude.
It's probably, it's probably everybody.
It's happening.
And I have like, uh, like all these formulas.
It's probably everything else.
That's okay.
Uh, okay.
You built it.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
So you're kind of an Excel nerd.
Yeah.
Okay.
But, but not not too.
But there's no problem with this then.
This work.
I mean,
it's been, uh, I've been stopped by interviews.
I've been through it from there.
I need to cover the front door.
Um, sometimes you know,
it would be nice to have like an app.
And then people can,
and get their block this day,
block this day.
You know how,
at the moment it's like,
if I look like he states off,
can we go inside?
Okay.
It's blocked off for you.
You're doing the manual schedule.
Yeah.
And he changes.
People are sick.
Yeah.
All the spendings.
But nothing is automated in this sense.
But there's no,
there's no aptitude that doesn't.
Okay.
But I mean,
it would probably be more expensive to build something
than to you.
