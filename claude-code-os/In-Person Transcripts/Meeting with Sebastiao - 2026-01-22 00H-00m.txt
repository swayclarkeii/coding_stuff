I like to see you meet you.
No, no, it's all good. I totally get it.
I totally get it.
I totally understand your idea of all of this.
I totally understand that.
It's all good.
It's just good to have more information.
Information is always good.
So you were saying you...
You can repeat this one all the time.
This is an idea which I didn't...
I tested, but I didn't start it.
But I like to start it.
With more water, big, the banana waste which is ordered like combined.
Like a batch.
Yeah, like a batch.
Everyone can order from all Germany or also also Germany.
And let's say we receive 400, let's start less 200 orders,
which we cancel on e-commerce or on Amazon.
Whenever they can order an e-commerce way, you know.
And collect all the orders.
And my brother go once a week and he bake all the 200s.
But I know which one.
And then we deliver it on the next day.
So they only have to wait one day after he bake it fresh, you know.
But how would that help your system here?
So right now you're saying that the system is that...
The system that doesn't work is that you're getting multiple orders at different times.
Yeah.
This was based on Erika.
Yeah, based on its Erika setup, where you had franchises across Germany.
And they all had different orders at different times and different amounts.
And what you want to do is you want to stream lines to your brother.
Only goes in.
Bakes once at a time.
A large batch.
Now, what happens if...
For example, are you imagining this like...
Let's just say we start February 1st, yeah.
And you're like, this product is open.
You have it online somewhere where people can make orders.
They're going on the 1st.
Somebody makes a order.
On the 1st you get 25 orders.
On the 3rd you get 17 orders.
On the 6th you get 100 orders.
And then you have some kind of threshold where you say,
we don't go into the kitchen until 300 orders.
Just say, just random number.
Now, the person that orders on the 1st...
And say you get the 300 orders on the 15th.
Yeah.
Say it takes 15 days to hit the threshold.
Just in general.
What is the communication between that person on the 1st and the person on the 15th?
Yeah, I always thought about it.
So when I was half this idea I thought we'd do it once in a week.
So we had four weeks.
Four times we're baking.
And four times we're baking.
So when you're on the 1st, you will know when your banana bites will bake fresh.
And the next thing you will get it.
Okay.
So you just order one of the firsts.
But you know the date of the fresh baking.
And you will know after the fresh baking you will get it next day.
Also we can stream it in the bakery when your banana bites will do it.
So you can see your banana is really fresh.
Yeah, yeah.
So it was an idea I had also, I don't know what it's supposed to be about.
Once in a week.
So I thought I had to go with the steam once in a week.
But he prepared two weeks of some weeks.
And yeah.
And then for the liver.
And this helps you because before your brother would have to go in on a Tuesday on a Wednesday
and try and bake all of this stuff.
It didn't make sense for coordination.
And then also for delivery.
Yeah, also for delivery.
They come once.
They take off and then spend.
And then they pass up with 20 with 20 friends all over Germany.
20 orders.
And this works.
Okay.
It works.
So now we have to do with 200 more.
And also the reason why I came up to this idea.
My brother was just, how you say, he couldn't do any more baking.
Because he was doing this since 2014-15.
You say, you don't want to go on this kitchen.
You want to build a team.
He teaches the guys.
Yeah.
Because he's still keeping special.
You don't want to give it to anyone.
So he will be over there.
If you don't want to be eight hours in the kitchen or something every day.
So I said, okay, then come once in a week.
Also, at the same time, he became father.
So he said, I don't want to be a baby.
I don't want to be a baby.
So I don't want to be any day.
And for me, it's also good.
So I don't have to work a lot.
We have one floor.
Maybe it will work.
I don't know.
When we started, we were looking now for a smaller kitchen.
But we couldn't do it.
Because I was on a lot on the way.
Two big kitchen productions.
There was one in dancing and one at once in Lichtenberg.
It was too much.
Too big in me.
Too big yet.
Too much.
So also for once a week.
Yeah.
This is supposed to be good.
But also I had this in this time because of the plan.
I wanted to vision anymore.
Because they give us this contract.
That we do it, we do it generally.
So therefore I invested, I went to speak production rooms.
Because it was based on a contract.
You will make it because we also tested.
We were selling 2,400 to 3,000 a week in just a billion.
Then we went to Frankfurt.
We sell five hundred just for testing.
And Hamburg was also up to come for the test.
But we knew it would work because Banner.
But I don't know at that time anyone wants parameters.
Also my bottle of Banner was so tasteful.
So it was it was working.
But this one one point I want to do in the future.
What is it?
What's happening with the company now?
Or the banana breads?
Is he just stopped it?
No, we don't stop it.
The company is on me.
On my company love music entertainment.
I'm writing the invoice on all of this.
But at one point maybe I will have to separate it.
But I'm not.
Because we don't do it too much.
We had some customers at this time.
It was not so big.
It was like cold coffee.
Maybe not cold coffee.
And cool coffee.
Sun coffee.
French rice.
We was delivering.
And I put it out just for my words.
So you can continue this.
And you want me an invoice.
So you can get the money out.
So he's still baking.
So he still has a kitchen.
He has a kitchen.
He has something like a French kitchen where he paid a little bit.
And he's going also once in a week.
And he's baking the small orders that the coffee have.
So what?
What systems are you using right now to do this?
Phone email.
This right now it starts to email.
Get orders to email.
That's too small yet.
They're getting from email.
Or they call him and say we need 18 next week.
And then he's baking for him and he delivered by himself.
So it's so small.
It's like baking the wood.
OK.
So baking the wood for me.
It doesn't.
That's not money.
Yeah.
Not for my buzz alone.
Yeah.
It's helpful.
So for you, you're thinking,
if at any point you want to build up this thing up again,
you're thinking about what a potential system would look like.
Which is for that?
What can we automatically do that it works?
My limit idea is just to have an e-commerce page, Amazon,
and advertising that the people start ordering.
So we came up to 200 or more.
Oh, a week.
A week, yes.
And what I'm just curious,
what is the...
The way even...
No, no.
What is there going to be the spark for you to initiate that move again?
Yeah, right now I'm really busy with other stuff.
My brother has only the creative guy.
He don't start looking for a new place.
So I have to do it.
Time.
I need time.
About time.
But I hope I can start it this year.
I just need a location.
And I will keep my brother in the ass to just start doing this.
And we already tested some more last year.
Last year?
I think last year we tested.
We tested last year.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
So this is how the company survived,
and how Corona was in a positive way.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes.
And, yeah, the music festivals and doing,
and I still have love to the music industry,
honestly, but I know it's don't bring it this money.
It's always the love.
It is what it is, right?
So always the love.
Right now I'm also starting to support McDonald's.
Come back.
So we are planning it towards this year, end of the year.
And the ideas right now,
to bring it back on the map,
to let you record once in a week.
So it's 52 times cover song.
I made one original.
And we will be posted.
And also we like to advertise.
One of the four, we want to advertise.
So you see that he's going a little bit.
So I'm still not an expert
on social media.
So if there's anything I can advertise
or do something that we can reach a lot of people
with the post and a little bit of money in it,
with the way.
Because he knows nothing about it.
I know nothing about it.
I just know it works and you give it with money,
but also you have to do it to know how to use it.
And I mean, it really comes down to the platform that you're looking at.
If you're looking at Instagram, if you're looking at TikTok,
they all have their little ecosystems as to how they do work.
I mean, when it comes to these kind of systems,
it really depends on what you want to do.
Because, okay, so what I do, you know,
what I do is like,
I work with companies or small businesses,
I would probably say max like 50 staff.
And I help them do two things.
Make more money or cut costs.
And save time, actually.
And I do this usually by looking at the systems of any company
and trying to identify what bottlenecks are,
where things work, where things don't work.
And then trying to either re-engineer these systems
and then also using AI, like automations,
and AI to pump these systems,
like to turn it up.
And so I kind of, what I usually call my company,
it's called Aloxa, it's an AI transformation.
And why I call it like this is a partner is that
a lot of companies really just like you said,
they don't know.
You think, oh, AI, what can it do?
How do I use it?
I don't know.
I got this jet GPD thing.
I use it every now and then.
I pay 20 euros fine.
And what I usually do, depending on, you know,
the level of education of different business owners,
there's a lot of training, education, understanding.
So I help them understand what this thing can do.
And then looking at their system,
we build custom solutions for their system.
So when it comes to, for example, social media,
there's a whole beast in itself.
Because there's different aspects of it.
There's the content.
You know, some people are like, I want more content.
Some people are like, I want to monitor my content.
Some people are like, I want to post and execute on my content.
There's always limitations.
The whole field is like, with AI,
it's like, you know, Mick can make an AI avatar,
if he wanted to, for example.
Where he creates an avatar that looks exactly like him.
And it does his posts.
And you know what I mean?
And it does things for him, for example.
He could also use it to say, okay, well,
I have this video that I've created.
I want to chop it down and put it into multiple posts on different platforms.
You know, there's the like coordination of the execution.
There's taking content and like making other types of content.
Like if you wanted to take one piece of content
and make it into a blog post or something like that.
So make it into a LinkedIn post.
You know what I mean?
You can take one piece of content and use AI
to make different pieces of content
and coordinate those things to go out.
Really, it really becomes what do you really want to do?
You know, what's the goal with that?
Right?
What's the goal?
However, one thing it doesn't do.
AI cannot, it cannot determine the strategy
that you're going to use in TikTok.
Do you see what I mean?
So why I say this is because one of my buddies
runs a company here, a German producer.
He runs a music company that makes like,
he started in Corona to make, what do they call it?
Like chill beats, low five beats and stuff like that.
And then he signed a couple of artists.
And to his understanding, he realized how TikTok works is there.
There's almost these little micro scenes that happen in TikTok.
And you have to almost create your own scene
and then stick your artist in it
and then create people.
And how do I explain it?
It's like the algorithm works when it thinks people
are all working around a scene.
Kids are posting it, they're into it, they like this thing.
So you have to either have that scene evolve organically
or you can create that scene.
And he decided to create it.
Cost him 10,000 euros a month.
But he did that thing, right?
And he realized, okay, this is how the TikTok one works.
The Instagram one is also very different, right?
It's post, after post, after post, what those viral,
how you structure those things, how you structure your intros,
how long they are.
Those are all things that you've kind of have to determine
because AI won't do that for you.
What AI will help you do is charge it.
It will help you like coordinate it.
So when you're like, okay, you know, Mick,
we got all this fucking content.
And imagine you needed an assistant to coordinate the content
to like go and do the post, the post has to go on Tuesday
and it needs to go out here and then it has to go here.
Then I want to get the data.
I want to find out what's happening on the data.
Pull in the data, like imagine an assistant
that will go in and say, okay, every Monday, Tuesday, Friday,
I post and I do all these follow-ups
and I follow up with fans, you know, you do contesting
or whatever the case is.
And then on Friday, I get pull out the data,
I give you a report.
These are things that AI can do.
It can almost be an assistant for you.
But the actual, not to say the actual content,
but the ideation, especially in music,
still has to be you, right?
If you decide, hey, I want to go with TikTok,
then it's about understanding what the ecosystem of TikTok is.
And then the plan is, okay, now I know what I want to do
in this ecosystem.
I know how I want to use Mick, what kind of content we want to create.
Then the question is, how can AI help me make this process easier?
You know what I'm saying?
So if you know 50 every week, you want to do 52 pieces of content,
you're like, okay, this is where we're going to shoot the content.
Now we've got to edit the content.
You know, this is how, but this is where we wanted to be placed
after we wanted to be in reels.
We wanted to be this side.
Then at some point, AI can help you to say, okay,
we're going to take this content.
We're going to break it down to 32nd pieces.
And I can automatically post it to this thing for you.
And then I could also automatically follow up with anybody
who likes it.
And then you can also do these things, right?
You know what I mean?
So...
You have a design that makes sense of it?
Yeah, I understand.
It slows me in more than a assistant than doing everything for you.
It's a good way to imagine it, right?
When you hear about agents and people talking about agents,
you know, they're like, they're like assistants.
So I would say to usually to clients that I work with,
what are things that you do that you don't want to do?
You don't like to do that take up all of your time.
And if you had an assistant, what tasks would you give them?
And most of them will tell me, okay, well, this is what we automate.
I create an assistant for you that does those tasks.
So for example, with your logistics company as well,
I'm sure there are a ton of things that you're doing.
In coordinating, talking, you know what I mean?
And in that way, you can also look at it and say,
okay, what are the tasks that, how am I communicating with my staff?
How am I staff communicating with me?
What are the tasks that I have to do on a weekly basis?
What is the information that I have to pass back and forth?
How long has it taken me to do it?
Invoicing all of these kind of things.
All of those things can be automated.
And put into systems that you basically look it over.
You know, there's a human in the loop.
And then you were like, okay, that looks all good.
I say, go.
And now it does the batching.
And so this is how I work with business owners.
Because what they need is time.
It's like you said it before.
I need my time back.
And why?
Because...
Time meeting there.
Yeah, time meeting there.
Most of the time, what a lot of business owners are doing is working
not on their business, but in the business.
And it's a lot of tasks.
It's a lot of tasks.
A lot of email follow-ups.
It's a lot of like, I got to assess this.
And the strategy, they come later.
It's like when I have time to do that.
When I have time to go look for a new kitchen.
When I have time to get those things done.
You know what I mean?
You'll get those things done.
But there's all the tasks you've got to do Monday to Friday.
Yeah.
That you're constantly doing, right?
And you know, there's also like, you know,
I work also with building, helping with voice agents.
Voice agents are also really a cool agent at this point where you can like...
You can do outbound and inbound.
So you can set up a voice agent that they do all your inbound calls.
All your requests, right?
Literally somebody call your phone.
Hey, what's up?
Are you doing book-a-call, book-a-meeting, book-a-what?
You know what I mean?
Or even outbound and the other.
And send out, okay, I have leads.
I'm going to call a fly leads.
Maybe you're getting leads to advertising.
They come in and you can qualify those leads with AI.
And then you can then use an agent to call the A.
To call and do more qualifications before you even get to the phone.
So you don't waste time.
You know what I mean?
So it's all about helping business owners get the time back
so that they can make more money or cut more costs.
So that's essentially what I do.
So I would say, I mean, if it's something you're interested in
in terms of like AI and how it can help you with all of your endeavors
because I work with all different kinds of businesses.
Like I work with a film company right now in Paris
who they do staffing for video productions and movie and film productions.
And so I'm helping them redo their whole internal system, right?
Like between their dashboards and all that.
It's like cut and paste and this has information has to be over here.
But this information is not repeated over there.
I'm helping them rebuild that system.
Also helping them streamline everything so that their staff can have more time
to work on getting their money.
Because they also found out that they have payroll issues.
They don't have the time to follow up with the money.
So they've got, you know, exactly.
So, you know, I work with companies like this.
I also work with like a real estate company, the Indonesia,
who, again, they're trying to find properties constantly.
But it takes some hours and hours at a time to go online and find properties.
So I built them a system that goes on all these popular Indonesian property sites.
Every two weeks, he gets an email, click, here are my new properties.
I can call them and, you know, I can build another system that starts to reach out.
If the property comes in, you can start to reach out to WhatsApp or whatever to find out more information on the property.
I mean, it's kind of endless in that way, right?
Or in Berlin, I work with a dead advisor.
He's a guy that's pretty much between like, you know, these large $500 million properties
that get built and private investors.
And if, as you can imagine, German bureaucracy, he's got fucking documents and documents and documents
that he has to use to like qualify different investors or developers.
He spends five to ten hours with every client just opening an email, looking at a document.
Oh, that's an expose that needs to go over here, you know,
then putting in some kind of system that tells him whether he wants to work with this person or not.
So I'm building a miniatire system that circumvents that whole thing.
You know, within 20 minutes, he can know from an email that comes in within 20 to 30 minutes,
whether he can work with this client or not.
And what it allows him to do is go from six or seven clients a year to potentially 15 or 20 clients a year.
You have to hand him over to him, right?
Well, his problem is not the handling, his problem is the qualification.
The qualification takes a lot of time, a lot of back and forth.
You know, in a mean he has to find out if they're the right documents,
look at the analyst analysis, then find out if they're more documents, then go back and forth about this.
And all of this can be automated.
You know, so if he can take out these basically five to ten hours per client,
then he can qualify clients quicker.
Because the problem also is that he can qualify a client and it takes him two or three months to do this.
And then it doesn't work out.
Then he's wasted that time.
So he needs to qualify quick.
If he can qualify in a week, both.
Yeah, right?
And also developers are going to different debt advisors, right?
So the quicker he can get back to them and say, yes or no,
the quicker he can get a potential client.
So anyways, so that's kind of what I kind of help business owners work with.
So for me, it would be me and I need to identify where I can save time,
where I can put my help and ask you what we can do.
Yeah.
What I would do is usually what I do is I call it discovery call.
And I would sit down and I would ask you really interesting questions about the company
and how things work.
What are the process?
What are the things you go through?
Because a lot of it is just in your head.
You just know it, right?
Or it's just things you do.
You do them.
You do them by design.
And even your business, your company, I can tell you're pretty resilient.
You have a lot of things in your head.
You know, a lot of things work.
And so it would be sitting down with you and trying to understand what are those processes that you go through.
And how much time does that take you?
What time is that?
And then we can identify things.
And then at the end of it, if you're like, well, hey, actually,
you know, it really drives me crazy.
You know, it really waits a lot of time.
We discover those things, find out where the real value is,
and then potentially build a solution to help you with that.
Yeah, the value is mostly time-safe.
What I was thinking last, last days,
not in contact with all meetings.
I decided to do an event.
And I thought maybe I don't need someone
to make the flyers in Photoshop or something.
And I was calling my friend.
He's now in Asia for the holiday.
He told me there's something.
It's create your flyers by himself.
Like, AI, like, Jet Liberty, but in flyer.
I wish I could have something like this forever.
So I don't need to book again someone who created a flyer for me.
Is something already a six?
Or it has to be built?
It depends on what you want to do.
Like, the thing is, for example,
like, we're just talking about this,
so this is just totally new to me.
But I know from flyers,
you want to vibe and image,
a feel of the actual color.
And then you want to put information on it.
And so what AI is not really good at
is saying, OK, give me an image and give me these words
and put this text on it and put it in the right place
and make it all good.
Like, it doesn't really, it's not really good at that.
But you could have systems that say, OK,
first thing is, give me an image.
Give me an image that is a mountain or a cityscape of Berlin
that looks like this.
And it has, you know, I mean, you give it the information you need.
It will produce an AI-generated image.
And maybe it produces three different ones for you.
So you have options.
And then you can have another system that says,
OK, well, I'm going to take that information now.
And now I'm going to, like, we call it variables.
You can put places where you say, I want a title here.
I want the doors open here.
I want my logo there.
I want this there.
And I want the, and this is your template.
And then you can just pump it in the next system.
What the information is that you want.
You could, you could talk to it if you want and say,
look, I want it to be, doors are going to open at nine.
Here's my address.
Here's my email.
I want my logo.
And then you can have another agent or another system that takes this information
and places it where you want it for you.
On that image, for example.
And then you have three or four at the end.
And you're like, OK, I like this one.
And you can tweak it or not, you know what I mean?
Those kind of systems that are more creative systems, I think.
They require, they're going to require you to be in the loop somewhere.
Right?
Because it's taste.
It's taste.
It's taste, right?
At the end of the day, you got taste.
Over time, it can learn what your taste is about.
You know, you can, like, feed it images after and say, like,
this one I liked, produce me something more like this.
This one I liked, produce me something more like this.
And you can train it to become a lot more aware of the direction
that you're going constantly, right?
But my recommendation for things like this is you put yourself in the loop at times.
You can put yourself in the loop and say, generate me four images.
And then you can look at the image and say, I like image one.
Then you can say, give me four more like image one.
Then you get four more like it.
Ah, now I like two of this one.
OK, now pump this in there.
Now use my information and throw that on here.
Your font is already, you know what I mean?
You can have different things where you have different styles of fonts.
It's all about setting up your sandbox.
If you know you use these kind of fonts, you know, you have this kind of information.
You set those things up.
And then you just direct it to do it.
And those things you can kind of put together.
But is there an app or a platform that will do that for you?
Not yet.
Not yet.
It's tough with like art, like film producing, editing, film editing.
These things are still a bit difficult for AI to do because it doesn't have taste.
Like if you have a short clip and you think that you would only take like the first 30 seconds of it,
or from 10 seconds to 27 seconds, this is the goal for you.
There's no way for AI to know that.
OK.
You know what I mean?
Like it can't just read through a video script and say,
I think this is the best part.
It can do it.
But you may be like, what the fuck did you just edit together?
Yes.
You know what I mean?
So you still need certain parts of the loop at this point where the taste is required.
Where you're like, I like that color.
Or I like that image.
Or I like that vibe.
Right.
You know what I mean?
So...
But it sounds like this, what you just say, could be created, Bill?
You could build those things.
But you still have to be in the loop with them.
So...
What I would recommend.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Like it's taste.
It's all...
It's just taste.
It's raining, but...
It's still just taste.
Like you got to make sure that it's on point.
You know what I mean?
But what about...
Because when you have...
When you need to print a fly out of the poster, you need a kind of sophistication to give it to the printer.
So you know...
You can use it for his machine to print it out in the best way.
In terms of the sizing or the resolution.
Right.
The resolution.
Right.
The resolution.
Right.
The resolution.
And the kind of...
The appropriation for the machines.
There's also one...
One of the last steps that was asking me, okay, what do you need?
For...
For what do you need it?
For big poster, for small poster.
So it's pretty different, right?
Well, it isn't...
I mean, it's something I could look into.
I mean, usually there's a workaround for anything.
My question would be, how many fires do you make a month?
I mean, flyers.
Flyers?
How many...
How often do you do this?
There's a good question, not much.
Like the 320 concepts guy.
But, yeah, not much.
That's a good question.
And it's not much to...
To sing about it, to do it.
But it's...
I thought about it because it's so less.
I don't know if it's available to give it for big money,
to one person who created also this.
Which is also, he needs some loops.
But, yeah, honestly, it's not much.
Because I'm doing so much difference.
And also, I was never a big, big fan star promoter.
He said, I was only...
I was doing my parties.
And then I was doing the tools.
Like, make the nettles or the swag.
I was also doing the swag tour.
You know, the swag guys?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, chance and Salomon.
I was happy to see him there.
But I never was the big one.
I do over 100 shows in a year or something.
This was never my aim.
I was doing mostly for the love.
So, right now, thinking there is a business out there.
The German was always like to go to a Schlager party or doing beers.
So, my idea now will be a couple of festivals in a year.
So, when I break it down, it will be not so much.
Maybe three or five festivals a year.
Yeah, but it will also be three or five images.
Yeah, yeah.
To bring it on posters.
That's why I was saying it didn't seem like a...
Or online, you know.
So, maybe it's not a big case.
I think...
I need to think about it for me.
It will be really helpful.
But now I'm also struggling and...
You mentioned a couple minutes ago about invoices.
And financial situation with the finance aunt.
You know, there is for me to hear they are coming to check you.
I just see that I lost a lot of invoices.
Which is really bad.
So...
Where did you lose them?
How?
I don't know.
Sometimes my brother also had a whole account on my name on the company.
Maybe it didn't give it to me or companies.
Maybe it didn't save it.
I don't know where it is.
Well, now I have to follow all of them.
And my thought was...
There is a possibility to be an eye who recognize invoices
and put it somewhere where all invoices will be categorized
or something different.
And also Ashif.
Ashif, them that you will always find them.
You just put something like when you have a Mac and sweet letters and it's come.
Archive them.
And...
What do you use Mac and you use what?
Google.
You use Google and Google Drive or things like this?
Yeah, well now I'm using Google Drive.
I would like to have something special just for me and my company.
Not Google Drive.
But with the logic system like Google Drive.
Maybe I don't have another choice to do with Google Drive or Apple Drive.
Well, it kind of depends.
I mean, you could use things like AirBase or AirTable Sorry.
It depends on if you want it to be...
If you're talking about a database or if you're talking about a storage system.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I think both.
Because I know I just got my Mac from a storage.
And I didn't really save a lot.
I saved a lot.
And I wish...
Maybe I think there is something...
I would like to have something daily safe.
Automatically, everything I'm doing is my Mac.
I'm like a cloud or whatever.
But if my Mac would get stolen again...
So that it's all there.
So it's only the hardware is gone.
But all my work is still there.
And I didn't build the structure right now.
But I have to do it now because last year...
Two times.
I'm going to make a good story.
Two times.
So this was...
The last time I was stolen off my car.
The one time I lost my attention.
My son got hurt and I put my laptop somewhere.
And I was only with my son.
Because I was worried.
And then I turned around when the car...
But it was not.
This was my...
But the second time I was...
My car was someone...
The opening.
For however...
Because I know.
My employee said they...
They said they can check your car.
When you open it...
To track it.
And then they can open it without you...
But I know.
My bag was there.
But my Mac was not there anymore.
So now I need to buy a new one.
And I want to...
From beginning I like to have something...
Everything I'm doing.
Whatever it is.
Smallest is possible.
I have to be safe somewhere.
If I can also create something like this...
From my own system.
So I just have to book something where.
But that's...
I can...
Everything I'm doing after the safe.
Also the text.
Well it sounds like there's two different things you're talking about.
Just a general backup of your system.
That's automated.
Automated.
Yeah, automated backup of your system.
And then you're also talking about...
It sounds like a bit of an organization of your system...
Which is like when it comes to invoicing and documents...
And having things automatically archived...
When they come in where they're...
Where they're put from categorized.
Am I clear?
Is that makes sense?
Yeah, for months and months...
From year to year...
And maybe cultural rise...
And what I have to pay...
And what I have to pay...
Some advertising...
What's your current system?
What do you do?
How does it work right now with all of these receipts and invoices?
Yeah, this is what I'm struggling right now.
Because I have to do...
I have to pay...
To pay for the finance and...
To 2023.
And since then...
I receive it.
You know...
Maybe...
Sometimes I put it in the system.
It's called...
There's a...
Maybe you know it as an amp...
A surfing...
A taxi...
So you...
It's called Lexwell.
You know, Lexwell is.
And...
And then I have to upload it by myself Lexwell.
Maybe sometime I forgot.
I don't know...
What happened?
But it was a lot...
It was...
It was a lot...
I think...
From thousands...
Over 1,100 books...
I lost...
I don't...
I can't find right now...
Over 300...
Well, I have to follow up.
And I think 2%...
2% will be not...
Be...
Can be back.
Because it just lost.
It was maybe just a paper as I remember.
It's not something that's coming.
Or also what I really hate is...
When you get...
Inwards is just...
They're male.
Not a digital.
There is something they can't do.
You mean post?
Post, yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe I lost it like this.
I need to figure it out.
But yeah, right now...
Most are coming via email.
And then I...
I have to upload it to Lexwell to connect it with the bank.
So you...
You get an email invoice or receipt.
And then you have to go into your email.
You do this every month?
Yeah.
You go into...
I'm trying to do it immediately.
But sometimes I just forget it.
But I can't have to save it.
You have to save it, download it.
Download it.
And upload it to Lexwell.
And then Lexwell takes care of everything.
Not really.
Lexwell just...
Save it and then you have to...
I was saying...
To organize what kind of...
Inwards this is.
In Lexwell.
In Lexwell also you have to...
Maybe they recognize it's recognized.
But mostly not.
So you have to...
To choose what kind of...
You just bought some tires.
You have to categorize it.
Drop downs.
Okay.
This is this.
This is this.
And you use Lexwell, why?
I started using Lexwell because I went from...
When I started my company.
I was in a big, big tax company.
You mean a tax bracket?
Yeah, tax.
Yeah.
No, yeah.
Stoy out.
Stoy out.
Stoy out.
Stoy out about this.
Oh, you were at a tax company.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a fucking...
It was really taking care of me.
And I was like a puppy, a dog.
Yeah, yeah.
And then they say...
You didn't grow much in the last few years.
We were hoping I was supporting you.
But you know you have to do your own ways.
Yeah, yeah.
And then...
I was looking for a new one.
And she said you have to work for it.
It was Lexwell.
And I do only the years upstairs for you.
You have to do it always.
So since then I'm doing it always when we see it.
So what's the tough part here?
What's the time consuming part?
And what's the tough part of your system?
I have to do it monthly.
I have to send it to a finance aunt.
Through Lexwell.
Through Lexwell?
Okay.
So I have to pay finance aunt after this.
Yeah, it's definitely time.
It's not moving there.
Is the time that you're spending in Lexwell or outside of Lexwell?
Most of the Lexwell also.
To get all the inwards together again.
When we know, take some things.
You want to take a coffee?
Yeah.
Coffee?
No, I just said when I take...
Oh!
So now you're going to drink.
I can make a picture and then upload it directly when I get to receive it.
And I can throw it away because it doesn't need it because it's on.
But sometimes you can't do every time you buy something for a company to do this.
Maybe you do like this and then it gets lost.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So I think there will be some...
Not much you can automate it.
Just you have to be focused when you have it.
Maybe I have to care.
I'm pocket for me and I'm doing this side.
So I don't later.
Then I have to do later night or somewhere and it's time again.
Yeah.
But this is those that you have to...
Which you receive directly.
But the most big, big inverses you will get via email.
But you get more email.
You get more...
Most of them from email.
Not the ones from the restaurants or stuff like this.
Yeah, more for them from email.
Not big ones.
There will be 10 you or something or 50.
It's not small.
But the big ones you will get on email.
And then those you got to go into the emails every month.
You got to download them.
You got to upload them into Lexware.
Yeah.
Okay.
This is what also sucks definitely.
And this takes some time.
Yeah.
It's funny actually.
I mean, I'm building a...
I've built a system for myself that does...
Like every month.
Well, almost every day.
It goes through my emails.
And takes all my attachments automatically.
So it's kind of what you're talking about.
It takes my attachments automatically.
And it determines, is this an invoice?
Or is this a receipt?
And it logs it into my own personal database.
And then what it does is it moves it around.
Because what my thing is I have to have every month...
Taxes...
My folder is ready for my accountant.
And so I have my VAT 2005 January or 2026.
And then at the end, this system will basically go to my hard drive.
It will go through my Google Drive.
It will go through my downloads folder.
It will go through my email.
It will go through my...
What else would there be?
My Expensify account, which is like anything that I've took with photos.
And then it does all the organizing for me.
And so this is kind of at the end of it,
the only thing I need to do is run the final process
that will create the folders, put everything where it needs to go.
And then it's done.
That's the end goal.
Because I hate this shit too.
This takes me fucking hours.
I did this shit on Monday and it took me six hours to just do all the stuff.
And so if this is kind of what you're talking about,
because I think if you're using Lexware,
there's just a point where there's a handoff.
The system has to hand off to Lexware.
Because if you're at the end of the day using Lexware,
within Lexware, there's not much that AI can do for you if you're using Lexware.
You know what I mean?
If you're not, then there's other systems.
But it sounds like there's two things.
It sounds like there's the collection of all of these things.
And then there's the internal, the external and the internal.
External is received from your pocket.
There's received from your phone, there's received from your download,
the ones from your email, everything that comes in.
You have to go find those things and then put them into my downloads folder
and then physically put them into Lexware.
And then in Lexware, I got to categorize this bullshit
and then, you know, read and then press go for my...
My story in Barata.
So...
It could be really easy, definitely.
But yeah, you have to go in Lexware also piece by piece.
The collecting and sending to Lexware will be already hot.
Like, when I make a picture, maybe I can send it where the system can collect it too, you know?
Like...
You can have it.
Yeah, depending on how you do it, depending on how it is.
Like, if you're doing it from iCloud, is that iPhone?
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, so it could...
I never even thought about this yet.
If you're doing it from iCloud, I'm wondering if it can read your iCloud photos
and look for receipts, for example.
Recognize a receipt and then pull it somewhere else, right?
It's interesting.
I don't know if it can do that.
I have to check into that.
Yeah, that's interesting.
Yes.
This is beautiful.
I mean, do you feel like that's one of the most annoying things you do?
Yeah, maybe it's currently right now.
Maybe it's currently right now because...
The reason why I'm doing this right now, because...
I would say tax accounting.
Tax accounting?
Yes, last year she dropped me because someone died on her...
Family or whatever.
Someone...
No, it was like a colleague or she was doing the same thing that she took over their client.
Okay.
So I didn't have the whole year, didn't have a tax account.
Ah, okay.
And so she didn't do the 23 one.
Now I have a new one and now because so long time ago,
it's been some time that they are making pressure.
They need this, this, this, this.
Now you've got to go back and find all of this stuff for 23.
Yes, and she sent me every time tax.
And I have to do my daily business, you know?
And she sent me all of this with any business because we need to finish all of this.
But it's also interesting for the future, how I can start from now on.
So I never would have to repeat a situation like this.
Someone brought me or whatever happened.
So it's going to be a structure from now on, you know?
From now on, it will be easier when this is something coming in the future again.
Therefore, for now, I don't think it's going to be hardly.
Because the date is on the 6th of February and the 17th February,
they will come and check all my financial things.
But yeah, for the monthly and daily business,
it would be nice to have a solution.
I have also several of email addresses.
Maybe sometimes when I have my notebook, I was using sparks.
Maybe you know it's sparks.
It seems like an intelligent email account.
I could have several of my emails all come in one.
So if it's love and music, or it's my banana bread stuff,
or logistic stuff, different email address,
I would see if all in one account like here.
And also I can work in a night.
And maybe this is not new, working in a night,
but send it out in a night, but it's going to be received at 8.
It was a change of for me, I like it.
But no, I think it's old-fashioned.
Yeah, but maybe there will be something like sparks.
Or sparks, as soon as go.
Another account which is more intelligent,
which can do more.
Maybe also organize the email,
which he already know how to answer it.
Any answer by himself?
I mean, this stuff you can do.
Yeah, yeah.
Something like this.
But on this, he can also collect all the invoices
that invoices are coming by himself.
Not that I have to see the email by myself.
The email just came.
I'm here with you.
It just came.
And it take it already and put it in for us.
Yeah.
Collect from all different email addresses, you know,
that I have.
And put it in some files.
And then I can go to legs when I'm uploading everything.
Just because I refuse to use cash money.
So because if we have cash, we have to have a backup.
Yeah, I don't like that.
I don't like that.
I don't like that.
I don't like that.
I don't like that.
The word backup is just.
So there's more stuff.
So everything I'm paying in and out, it's on bank.
So therefore it's easier for me to put anything in next year.
Well there's two questions I have for you.
It sounds like the administrative,
like, administrating yourself and the invoicing
and everything between all of these three companies.
It's often stressful.
And getting this all together for the end of the month,
selects where it just takes up time.
Yeah.
That sounds like one thing.
Yes.
The other thing is what?
Tell me a bit about the logistics company.
Because you mentioned it, but what exactly is it?
I'm pulling this in.
I'll wait for something to reference.
So the logistics company,
everything I was thinking,
it's not really much.
I can't make automatically what I'm saying.
That's what it's suffering me.
I'm curious what it is.
Yeah.
We're delivering parcels for companies,
for their customer.
So we are going there and pick it up
and put it in our transports for the past and delivering.
Okay.
And we're doing this daily, daily base.
And I hire drivers to drive this moods
and at least cars to use the cars for these moods.
You least them?
At least the cars.
To them?
No.
At least the cars for myself
and offering companies to make the service for them.
Okay.
So let's me, we go there and take the parcels
and deliver it to their customers.
And how do they find you?
How do companies find you?
How do companies find me?
Yeah, I was offering them this.
Because doing the bananas and breads time
are starting to win transports.
So we can deliver the bananas.
And then a higher guy,
he was driving, he was a driver for different companies.
He was delivering for DHL, DPD, Amazon and GLS.
And he told me, hey, if you get some more cars,
you can offer them that you can work for them,
that you can deliver their parcels for them.
So for the parcel companies,
not for businesses like Bosch or something?
No.
You're not working directly for them?
No, no, not directly for them.
I go to them who needs the help,
like DHL, all of them,
they need support and stuff.
So I came in in this way
and so we do a contract
and based on a contract,
I go there and take the parcels
and bring them to the customers,
also company customers,
not only private customers.
So my base,
main or main tasks are to handle the drivers
and the cost.
To manage the drivers and the drivers.
And they get their initiatives
through a system that has a system.
Or you have a system.
They have a system, we use the system,
just for bringing us to the customer.
So we have the names and the address and all of this.
So now my most,
I don't know what I can say, yeah.
It's maybe quality, you know.
The KPIs, but I can't,
there's a day of the day.
It's the human, they have to do quality,
quality of jobs.
The drivers.
The drivers, and sometimes they are,
they're drivers, they're doing good.
And some of them are not doing good.
You mean late or forgetting that?
No, just to, all of this quality,
you know, to do it in a quality way.
And they are young.
They are in their 20s, early 30s.
Not all of them have families.
Some of them, they're just, you know,
some of them, no German was doing this.
All foreign drivers.
They came from, maybe from Argentina,
to stay here for two months or two months,
and then they're living again.
So they don't care maybe about quality.
But if you have family,
the drivers and all of this,
you got to think long term.
You maybe think twice before you drop the package
just in front of the door.
Because you know, it can be lost.
And then it's on him or me and all of this.
So for this day,
just the human behavior, how to do it.
The only thing I was, I just do it.
Honestly, I just do it.
A starting doing in October was,
because we're doing every day meeting.
To remind them how to act outside,
when we're going to the customers.
And also just to give them some ideas
or to see what the problems outside, you know.
So we have a small chat every day.
And mostly it's about protections and the quality.
And I was thinking long time ago,
hey, what is when the guys get reminded
how to work outside the quality way
with a Chris,
that you have to do it on daily basis.
So I found one Indian guy.
He created an app for me,
for William Easy Money.
And he built a Chris,
which is based on daily questions.
They have to question,
they know the answers,
the best case.
They don't know,
the Chris will tell them,
which one is the correct one.
They choose the one one,
and he said, this is one,
because of this,
or we choose the correct one,
this correct one,
because of this.
So my idea was,
okay, when they do it,
they have to do it every day.
And if they don't do it,
then I can cut them a little bit money.
But so they have to do it.
And they get,
just remember every day
how to act outside the quality way.
This was my idea how to,
how I can reach the KPIs,
or more quality,
because I'm doing this now,
over here to tell them how to deliver,
the correct way,
but we're still...
It's not working.
It's not working.
Did the Chris work?
No, we're just,
we're going to start it now.
It just finished a couple weeks ago.
You mean you finished building it?
We finished building it.
And now I'm going to release to the drivers,
and then we'll see if it's going to help.
And if it's helped,
yeah, I can sell it maybe to the company.
But yeah, this was the one thing I have,
but we're now,
to make it automatically,
in some kind of way.
Well, you know, the thing is,
whenever I work with clients,
it's really about value.
And when the thing is,
unless it's a real problem,
I won't build it.
I won't help with it,
because it doesn't solve a problem.
Whenever we think in like,
oh, it could be something,
we're already in a space where it's like,
that's not a real problem.
Real problems are like,
I don't want to do this anymore.
And I will pay you
to get rid of that thing.
Because that's that.
Problem solved was always the key.
You know what I'm saying?
So it's more about,
it's more about religious finding out,
like, what are things that you really need
to get taken care of,
like off your plate,
so that you can have more time
and more headspace to do other things, right?
Which essentially allows you to make more money.
And that's the real key, right?
So,
so I mean, from what I kind of heard,
a lot of it is your personal systems between,
I mean, you as a business owner
of multiple business,
you're trying to organize
and orchestrate
and you're trying to,
especially with administrative, operational.
How do I back things up?
How do I keep things backed up?
How do I find all of my invoicing?
How do I get those?
You know what I mean?
How do I do all of those things
and keep that kind of security
and organizations together?
So I don't have to manually go
and do those things every day, every week, every month.
This seemed to me,
through our conversation,
to be the most pressing thing for you.
Yes, yes, right?
Like,
yeah, this is...
And your flyers.
Yeah, this was just a maybe lazy idea.
But yeah, currently,
yeah, maybe you're just so much perfect.
But what I'm also curious about is
what, how can I do business with AI?
If there is there something,
I can work with AI,
which can be not only save me time
or whatever,
but can me also, yeah,
pursue that I can make money on it.
If there is something,
which I don't know yet,
maybe I can brainstorm with someone
like you or myself.
And this is also what I'm interested in,
because I don't know about it.
I just weed some subtitles
or like, you get milled me up by AI.
AI makes so much progress.
I mean, you know,
for sure, right?
It really depends on what it is you're thinking about.
Like, AI can be used
in a way that if you have an idea
and you're like, okay,
I got an idea and I want to build this thing.
AI is going to help that thing produce a result
and then you're going to sell that product.
Like, if you're thinking about on a product level,
like, I have an idea that,
I don't know,
kind of think of things that you've already done.
For example,
you're a business that you're doing,
and you're festivals.
So, with your festivals,
for example, you're like,
okay, I want to do bigger festivals,
or I want to do more festivals,
or I want to, you know,
I don't know what that thing is,
but the festivals seem like
you have leads, you have an input and an output,
you have to reach more people,
you have to invite more people,
you have to deal with more people, right?
And with that, you can make more money.
And maybe it's capped because right now,
you have a certain type of venue,
maybe you have a certain type,
how big your team is,
so you can only handle a certain amount of things.
I don't know what those caps are for you,
but AI can help you by helping you get a bigger output.
If I needed to get to more people,
if I need to invite more people,
if I need to deal with more people,
instead of one person doing it,
you can have AI assist and help you
to do those communications,
so that therefore,
you can have more people at your event.
Like, those things can be done.
But, yeah, it's really,
it really, it really depends.
Like, if you want to build a product,
then AI can definitely help you build that product.
It really depends on what the product is,
and where you want to put it within it.
That's usually a big upfront cost,
obviously, right, because you're building a product.
At the end, you need to have a business model.
But you've got to have a business model.
That someone has to pay for whatever it is,
so you can make business on it, you know?
But right now, yes.
I will think about,
but me then, you're always someone with some things.
I really,
also, if you can meet again,
or something about also the banana bites business,
I need to do something with it,
because I buy really expensive machines,
so it's all somewhere in the storage.
I'm paying only the rent every month,
but it's still there.
It was huge.
It was huge.
I buy a machine,
which is a packing machine.
Okay.
You know, to pack the banana bites,
and the foil,
and the plastic.
And the plastic thing?
I buy it, it's there.
I buy it because we was needed 12 people
to pack thousands of banana bites.
I was just imagining the cost of this personal stuff
when we are going to Germany wide.
So right now,
then I bought this,
because a new German wide business will come,
and it was packing us the banana bites hundreds in a minute,
just like...
Jump, jump, jump.
It's still there.
It's still there.
It's still there.
I wish I really wish to do something with banana bites,
and to see if this idea can be a good business model,
which can bring us a little bit of money over any year.
But it sounds like you need a new business model for this idea.
Yeah.
Do you have it already?
No, the idea is that what I told you,
to collect the orders within one week,
and then we deliver it.
This is the idea,
which I want to test it really,
German wide, sure,
have to do marketing investment,
to see how much I have to invest,
how much it's coming in one month,
or one week, or whatever.
And to see if it's going to...
can grow,
because it's make...
My brother's banana bites
can really make you addicted on it,
when you taste it.
And this is the hope,
I'm saying that the people will order more and more and more
in a week to week for months,
so it can be able to...
can be built as a brand,
not only in Germany,
not only in Berlin, I mean,
but also German wide.
No, when you know how you can get it,
in a way like...
you are in five-book,
in Munich,
you order it next day,
it's here, you can...
you can eat it,
what you don't get in Munich,
because no one can do this,
like my brother,
because it's...
in Germany, you say,
hunt back.
You know?
You know, funny thing,
I didn't know,
because I come from Germany in the street,
when we were at...
at Gorillas,
it was our customer.
They fucked up with...
how they called...
maybe you know this guy.
Yeah, yeah.
It was doing this...
cinch neck.
Yeah, yeah.
Cinnamon.
Yeah?
They came to us and said,
can you do the cinnamon?
I said, yeah,
we can't do the cinnamon.
I said, no, no, no,
I'm especially on Bayern,
where I said,
this is a new business.
Let's do it.
So we hire someone to do the cinnamon rolls.
Cinnamon rolls.
Cinnamon rolls.
So it was not the same like...
it's like tight for both.
Then we get someone
who gave us the recipe of tight for both.
We did it one in one like they did it.
It was not taste the same.
It didn't taste the same.
It didn't taste the same.
We did one like them.
It was one of the guys
who was working for tight for both.
And it was in Hamburg.
I don't know how we get this contact.
He came from Hamburg to have us to do it.
And you can still know.
It wasn't one to one.
So therefore I know
my brother's banana bread
will not be copied by someone.
And if you eat at once
and you are living in Munich,
you will eat...
you want to order it again.
This is my hope that this idea will work.
But we need to see...
Yeah, we need to do it in action to see what is okay.
400 orders, 200 orders are more or less.
So I can spit on it.
This is my idea.
I'm thinking to...
I mean, two things that I can help you build
is a system that...
a system that helps you find...
There's a system that I hear...
we got to find more customers, right?
They got to find customers.
They got to make orders.
You got to bring those things in.
Those things can be done.
A system can be built that does that.
And...
And then there's a system that...
finding leads.
You need to find more customers.
You need to do advertising.
Finding them and bringing them in.
You know what I mean?
And then kind of...
It kind of works all in the same.
You're finding them.
You're bringing them in.
And then when you get to a threshold,
there's time to go.
Notification.
Boom.
You know, notify all the people.
Keep them up to date.
Here's the tracking.
You know what I mean?
Those kind of things you can also...
you can build.
That's the question of like,
what's your budget to invest in something like that?
And when do you want to do that?
That's really...
That's really the question.
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure.
I need a concept on this.
Which is really work.
Of course, my...
Understanding, yeah.
You need to get the customers.
And all you get the customers in my view,
which I have is only when you put every time somewhere
that you get the customers.
You should sell a banner by CDs,
music, tickets, whatever,
every time you need to make the end of time.
But if the investment will make it everything easier,
like you have to spend less money,
then it will be worth it, you know?
Or whatever,
it will be saved money on the other side,
or time, whatever, you know?
So I need to know the concept.
Yeah.
But now I have just basic idea.
But the structure behind,
just like I said,
if it's in the end,
it helps to grow fast,
or normal, whatever.
You have to go for months to months,
or sometimes some months will be less,
whatever.
But on me,
it always will be dependent on the budget
of the marketing you have to do, you know?
And if you find an idea or concept,
it will be saved here and there,
something, whatever,
it will be worth it, you know?
Well, I mean, the marketing,
like how you're going to market,
you know, what that image looks like,
and how you, you know, the music and stuff,
that's you, right?
You create that marketing,
yeah, that part.
What you're talking about is,
once you have reached the customer,
once somebody clicks on the ad,
oh, shit, I want that,
what happens for them, right?
What, how, how is their information taken?
How is their information,
where is it put?
Is, how is it put into some kind of database?
How is all of that information filtered?
How is all of that information?
How are the payments to, you know what I mean?
Like those kind of things can also,
can all be automated at the end,
right on the back end.
Because right now it sounds like your system
is a lot of emails,
orders coming in,
yeah, I have to open the email,
I got to read it,
I got to see what that means,
I got to communicate that to someone,
I got to communicate to other workers,
you know what I mean,
whoever is helping him with it,
then you have to go into place
and then you got to make it,
and then you got to,
you got to communicate back to them,
when things are going to be delivered,
when things are happening,
this is all manual, right?
So, that can be automated.
This is all,
this is the part that saves you the time,
right, so you can kind of have a notification,
like for me it looks like,
or what I'm hearing,
it's kind of sounds like,
an ideal situation would be,
you're just basically taking your orders
and logging everything into your databases,
and just basically telling you,
when we fire,
like when we're ready to fire,
okay, we're ready now,
like you don't,
you understand what I mean,
like the ad machine is running,
and that's going to run on Facebook,
on Instagram or wherever, right?
Or wherever people are that you're going to get it.
And then once people click,
what you want to see is,
okay, that thing happened,
that person's in,
I got one more order,
this is how many orders they're having,
and this is the date that they want to receive it.
There will be a specific date.
A specific date that they're going to receive it, exactly.
And then you're just piling people into this number,
and then you know,
on this date,
this is how many I have,
this is what I got to go in and do,
and you get a notification about that, for example.
And then from there,
you also want a notification system
that goes the other way.
Your shit is being baked,
your shit is finished,
your shit is in the truck,
your shit is on its way, right?
Like all those things could be,
that's an automatic system.
Like you want something on Amazon or something,
but yeah.
I mean, this is what I'm,
what I'm trying to actually understand for in my head
is what you're thinking, right?
So this is why I'm saying this,
this is what,
this is the system that it sounds like.
I want to be able to,
to do my ads,
get my people,
funnel them,
I have my timelines,
my weekly timelines,
everybody's funneled into that.
Then my brother goes into the,
it goes in and bakes,
or whomever with him,
those bakes happen,
and then there's communication
back towards, you know,
to the drivers,
to whoever else,
whoever's delivering,
however it's getting out,
there's the communication in the other end.
And that system is going to happen every week
on a weekly basis.
That's what it sounds like.
And then you have your,
you have your invoices
that are going to come in
for this company,
that company,
and you need something
that potentially will,
take care of that, right?
Those sounds like the two things
that you're talking about.
So I think with the first thing,
if this is something you're interested in,
I can go back and think about
what a system would look like,
what something would look like for that.
And imagine it,
and we could talk about it again,
and for the other thing,
I could also tell you,
like I talk,
I look at this as your kind of business organizer,
and that way you're,
you're your financial,
financial organizer.
I could also,
I would also,
maybe we have one more call
to just,
and really want to understand
your process.
I just need to understand,
anything that I'm missing,
like the step-to-step-to-step,
you know, I know that you get the invoice,
in the restaurant,
you either take a photo of it,
or you put it in your pocket,
and you lose it,
but you take a photo of it,
and then you take that photo,
and you put that photo somewhere.
You see what I mean?
Like,
then you have to go into
wherever you have your photos,
and you've got to take that photo
from your eye photo,
or something,
I don't know,
wherever you do,
then you put this into a download folder,
and then you have to put that picture
into Lexware.
Yeah, so that's the process with that.
And then you have your invoices
that come in on all your multiple emails,
you have to open up the email,
read through it,
download it, download it,
the download folder,
and put that in.
Yeah.
And then you do the same thing for,
I don't know,
if an email comes from,
I guess those are the two places,
emails,
or post, you said.
Then you get an email by post,
then you've got to take a photo of that thing,
you've got to go through that process,
iPhone, whatever,
and so,
if that's the whole process,
then I could,
I could think about something
that would work for that,
and then what I would come back
and talk to you about is,
hey, this is what I'm thinking about.
What's your budget?
What are you thinking?
This is what it would cost,
in terms of that.
Or this is what we'd be looking at.
And if it's something that you're like,
yo, I want to press the button on it,
then you press the button.
If you're like,
no, I rather lose my receipt,
so I'm good.
Then that, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
I would go also a little bit sure,
my order, my process,
and see if I can find something,
I can tell you,
which can be solved by,
I don't have a budget,
or what I'm saying now,
just what came in my mind,
but maybe there's something more,
as now I understand what you're doing.
For the Banana Breads idea,
yeah, it's not pressure on it,
because before I can start this
and also invest this,
I need to have a,
just new bakery,
where I can get all the stuff back
from the storage,
and start,
and start with a new,
from now on,
to do the Banana Breads business,
which I also don't want to run by myself,
because I got a lot,
a lot other stuff to do.
This is also the reason why maybe it's not done yet,
because my order is only creative.
Yeah, I couldn't need a clone for me,
thinking I can do more,
but I wish I can do it this year,
but I don't know when you can start it.
But as soon as I know,
I have a fun something,
I'm looking, some time to time,
looking at Emo Scout,
if there's something small,
small location,
and I also have an interest
to not only bake there,
maybe to start with something else,
which we can sell
on Uber Eats,
or a different handle or something.
I want to use this new location
for the business.
Therefore,
it's not my aim just to look for bakery,
a bakery where we can also...
You can also rent it out or something.
We can do ghost kitchen stuff.
Ghost kitchen.
This is my idea,
therefore,
but now,
maybe I can do it more,
more daily or something,
so maybe I will find,
as I find all the other production rooms that we have,
but it's totally
in new business,
starting it all,
because on this,
the business as we started was easier,
because we get the orders
and we deliver.
This one is a bit more important.
This one we have to make it happen,
the orders come in.
You got to do everything.
Then you have to bake it,
you have to do the distribution now.
So it's much.
And because the business started like this,
I want to go back like this,
so it's easier.
It's easier.
This is the hardware.
You get the orders done.
I got one more question about your whole financial,
like the organization.
What?
You use iPhone?
I photos.
I cloud, obviously.
Are you using...
What are you using for your email?
I was using Spark.
You were using it not anymore?
Because my laptop is away.
I have no...
normal laptop,
Android laptop,
so I go to that account myself.
I have to go to
server's account to get the emails from there.
So you use Spark Web?
No.
I use the different
where I...
Where I have the contract
with my email.
What is it?
What are you using?
Strato?
Strato.
Strato I have?
Strato.
Strato.
Strato.
S-T-R-A-T-O.
Yeah.
Web mail.
I go to Web mail for one...
I use this also on the half.
I have one and I use blue.
So there's different
domains where I create my emails.
But the company that you're using,
that you're...
Where your...
Where your love and music.
No, no, no.
S-Z-O-H-O.
And I use Google workspace
for my different email.
Yeah, I also use Google.
You use Google workspace?
Yes.
But the others are like
when you want to do a website,
then you get an email.
You save it domain,
and then you need to space
somewhere workspace.
Yeah, yeah.
So there's a lot of companies
who offer this.
Einstein, Einstein,
Strato,
or other ones.
And on Spark,
which was on my MacBook.
Takes all of these together.
Takes all of this together.
And I receive in one email accounts
with one big like Outlook.
Yeah.
Like Outlook.
I was receiving all of them there.
Okay.
Okay.
So everything like Outlook.
Okay, that's what I was trying to understand.
Yeah.
Okay.
And then you got Lexware.
And then you use Lexware.
Then I use Lexware.
Let's use the storage stuff.
To prepare for the
effects of content.
Once in a year.
Yeah.
So we'll do the hours
abs just to call the nominee.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And for doing this after use it
in a correct way.
So there's no mistake happens.
If mistakes happen,
it's great a lot of work again.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah.
Let me think of something.
And then I'll send you a link
to chat like next week.
We can just have a meeting.
Yeah.
Like a video call.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wait no.
Yeah.
Do it.
Anyway.
Then we'll see when we can find a time
where I know I'm really stressed
because of the finance.
I'm pretty full.
It's coming.
Sorry.
Yeah.
So I have to work all day and night
to create this.
But then on my daily business.
But really find day like today.
I wanted to catch up with Pamela
also but she's not there.
And we was first in the hotel.
Yeah.
We didn't even get her coffee.
Anything right now because she
made us depend on her.
Oh.
Yeah.
But now I need to go.
