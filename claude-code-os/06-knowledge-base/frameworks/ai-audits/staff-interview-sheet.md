## 1. Setup (3 min)

**Say this:**
> "Thanks for taking the time. I'm talking to the team to understand how work actually flows day-to-day. This isn't a performance review - I want to find the boring, repetitive stuff that steals your time so we can fix it. There are no wrong answers."

> "I'm recording for notes. Is that OK?"

**Rapport:** "How's your week going?"

---

## 2. Role Overview (7 min)

**Ask:**
> "Walk me through a typical week. What do you do on Monday morning, and how does your week flow from there?"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What triggers that?"
- "Then what happens?"
- "Who do you hand it to?"

**Capture main activities:**

| Activity | Frequency (daily/weekly/monthly) |

| "What do you have to do over and over?" | |
| "Where do things get stuck or lost?" | |
| "What makes you think 'there has to be a better way'?" | |

## 4. Process Deep-Dive (17 min)

**Say:**
> "Let's walk through [PAIN POINT] like I'm shadowing you. What's the very first thing you do?"

**For each step, ask:**
1. "What do you click/open first?"
2. "Where does that information come from?"
3. "What tool are you in?"
4. "What do you do with it?"
5. "Where does it go next?"

**Capture the workflow:**

## 5. Quantification - Apply the 4 C's (7 min)

**For the main pain point:**

| C | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| **Count** | "How many times per week do you do this?" | |
| **Clock** | "How long does each one take?" | |
| **Consequence** | "What happens when this goes wrong?" | |
| **Chain** | "Who else has to deal with it when it breaks?" | |

**Calculate:**

- × 52 = ______ hours/year

**If they say "I don't know":**
- "Is it closer to 1 hour or 10 hours per week?" (anchor with range)
- "Think about last Tuesday specifically. How much time?" (specific day)
- "How many [invoices/emails] last week? How long each?" (count instances)

**Their answer:** _______________________________________________

**Ask:**
