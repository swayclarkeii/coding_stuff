| 4. Quantification | 30-40 min | COI - Cost of Inaction |
| 5. Scope & Next Steps | 40-50 min | Who to interview, timeline |

---

## Phase 1: Rapport & Context (5 min)

### Opening
> "Thanks for making time. Before we dive in, give me the 2-minute version of [COMPANY] - what do you do and how does the business work?"

### Listen For
- Revenue model
- Team size and structure
- Volume metrics (clients/month, transactions/week)
- Pain hints (they often volunteer problems early)

---

## Phase 2: Goals (7 min)

### Short-Term (6-12 months)
> "What are you trying to achieve in the next 6-12 months?"

Probes:
- "What does success look like?"
- "What's the number one priority?"

### Long-Term Direction
> "Where do you see the business in 2-3 years?"

Probes:
- "What needs to change to get there?"
- "What's holding you back?"

---

## Phase 3: Pain Discovery - Top of Mind (18 min)

### The 5 Questions (in order)

#### Q1: Most Significant Problem (4 min)
> "What's the most significant problem in your business right now?"

Probes:
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "When did this become a problem?"
- "Who does this affect?"

#### Q2: What It's Costing (4 min)
> "What is this problem costing you per month - in time, money, or opportunity?"

Probes:
- "If you had to put a number on it..."
- "What could you be doing instead with that time?"
- "What revenue is this blocking?"

#### Q3: How Long (2 min)
> "How long has it been like this?"

Probes:
- "Has it gotten worse recently?"
- "What changed?"

#### Q4: Future State - If Nothing Changes (4 min)
> "If nothing changes in 6 months, what does this look like?"

Probes:
- "What breaks first?"
- "What's the worst case?"
- "How does this affect your other goals?"

#### Q5: Magic Wand (4 min)
> "If you had a magic wand and could fix one thing tomorrow, what would you change?"

Probes:
- "What would that free you up to do?"
- "What becomes possible if this is solved?"

## Phase 4: Quantification (10 min)

### The 4 C's Framework

**For every pain point, get these four things:**

| C | Question for CEOs | What You Get |
|---|-------------------|--------------|
| **Count** | "How often does this happen?" | Frequency |
| **Clock** | "How much time does this take?" | Duration |
| **Consequence** | "What does it cost when it goes wrong?" | Error impact |
| **Chain** | "Who else is affected by this?" | Ripple effect |

**Count × Clock = Time Spent**
**Consequence + Chain = Business Impact**

### Time Value
> "You mentioned [X hours/week] on this. If that time was freed up, what's that worth to you?"

### Revenue Impact
> "What revenue is this problem blocking or delaying?"

### Error Cost
> "When this goes wrong, what does it cost you?"

### Opportunity Cost
> "What can't you do because of this problem?"

### Quantification Summary
Capture:
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Hours/week | |
| Hourly value | |
| Monthly time cost | |
| Revenue blocked | |
| Error/rework cost | |
| **Total COI/month** | |

---

## Phase 5: Scope & Next Steps (10 min)

### Staff Interviews
> "I'd like to talk to the team members who actually do this work day-to-day. Who should I speak with?"

Get:
- Names and roles
- Best contact method
- Availability windows
- Any sensitivities (don't want staff to feel evaluated)

### Timeline & Budget
> "What's your timeline for solving this?"
> "Do you have a budget range in mind?"

### Next Steps
> "Here's what happens next: I'll interview [NAMES], map the workflows, and come back with a proposal that shows the ROI. Does [DATE] work to reconnect?"

---

## Post-Interview Checklist

### Immediately (5 min)
- [ ] Note the #1 pain point
- [ ] Note the COI estimate
- [ ] Note staff names to interview

### Within 24 Hours
- [ ] Review Fathom transcript
- [ ] Extract key quotes (for proposal)
- [ ] Send staff pre-interview questionnaires
- [ ] Schedule staff interviews

## CEO vs Staff: What Each Gives You

| Data | CEO Provides | Staff Provides |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Pain priority | Business impact | Daily frustration |
| Cost | Revenue/budget | Hours spent |
| Scope | What matters most | What's actually broken |
| Process | High-level overview | Step-by-step detail |
| ROI framing | "Worth $X to solve" | "Takes X hours/week" |

**You need both:** CEO gives the business case, staff give the technical scope.

---

## Key Quotes to Capture

Look for quotable moments that express:
- Frustration ("I spend hours every week on...")
- Cost awareness ("This is costing us...")
- Vision ("If this was fixed, I could...")
- Urgency ("We can't keep doing this...")

These go in your proposal slides.
