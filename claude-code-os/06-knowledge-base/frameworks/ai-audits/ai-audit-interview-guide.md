# AI Audit Interview Guide

**What to expect and how to prepare**

---

## What Is This?

We're mapping your workflows to find hidden time sinks — repetitive tasks stealing hours from your week. Think building inspection before renovations.

---

## What We Need From You

**1. Quantify time** — Not "takes a while." We need:
> *"4 hours per client pulling data from 5 platforms"*

**2. Show real workflows** — Screen share the actual process, not the sanitized version.

**3. Be honest** — Tell us about work-arounds, bottlenecks, and "we've always done it this way" processes.

---

## What This Is NOT

| Concern | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Replacing jobs | Saving you hours for higher-value work |
| Blame game | System problems, not people problems |
| Performance review | Discovery, not evaluation |

---

## What This IS

Saving time. Reducing frustration. Fixing what's broken.

---

## Confidentiality

Calls are recorded for notes only. Your input is anonymized — like a doctor-patient conversation.

**Let's find some wins together.**
