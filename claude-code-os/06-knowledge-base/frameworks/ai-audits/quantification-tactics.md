# Quantification Tactics

**Purpose:** Getting numbers when people can't or won't give direct answers

---

## The 4 C's (Core Framework)

**For every pain point, get these four things:**

| C | Question | What You Get |
|---|----------|--------------|
| **Count** | How many times per week? | Frequency |
| **Clock** | How long does each one take? | Duration |
| **Consequence** | What happens when it goes wrong? | Error impact |
| **Chain** | Who else is affected? | Ripple effect |

**Count × Clock = Time Spent**
**Consequence + Chain = Business Impact**

*Every tactic below helps you get one of these four data points.*

## Why Quantification Matters

| Without Numbers | With Numbers |
|----------------|--------------|
| "This takes a long time" | "4 hours/week × 52 weeks = 208 hours/year" |
| "It costs us money" | "€5,000/month in errors and rework" |
| "We should fix this" | "ROI: Fix for €10K, save €60K/year" |

**Numbers sell proposals. Vague pain doesn't.**

## The Problem: Why People Can't Give Numbers

| Reason | What to Do |
|--------|------------|
| Never measured it | Help them estimate |
| Feels too variable | Get a range, not a point |
| Fear of being wrong | Reassure rough is fine |
| Don't want to admit | Reframe the question |
| Genuinely don't know | Work backwards |

---

## Tactic 1: Anchor with a Range

**When they say:** "I don't know, it varies..."

**You say:**
> "Is it closer to 1 hour or 10 hours per week?"

Then narrow:
> "So somewhere in the 3-5 hour range?"

**Why it works:** Easier to react to numbers than create them.

---

## Tactic 2: Work Backwards from a Specific Day

**When they say:** "It's hard to say..."

**You say:**
> "Think about last Tuesday specifically. How much time did you spend on this?"

Then calibrate:
> "Is last Tuesday typical, or was it more/less than usual?"

**Why it works:** Specific memory beats general estimation.

---

## Tactic 3: Count Instances × Time

**When they say:** "Each one is different..."

**You say:**
> "How many [invoices/emails/requests] did you process last week?"
> "How long does a typical one take?"

Then calculate:
> "So 20 invoices × 15 minutes = 5 hours/week"

**Why it works:** Breaks big number into small, knowable pieces.

---

## Tactic 4: Compare to Something Known

**When they say:** "I really can't estimate..."

**You say:**
> "Does this task take longer than your morning coffee, or less?"
> "Is it a 5-minute thing or a 30-minute thing?"
> "More like a quick email, or more like a full meeting?"

**Why it works:** Comparison is easier than absolute estimation.

---

## Tactic 5: Use Frequency to Build

**When they say:** "Sometimes a lot, sometimes nothing..."

**You say:**
> "In a normal week, how many times do you do this?"
> "And each time takes roughly...?"

Then build:
> "So 10 times × 20 minutes = 3+ hours/week"

**Why it works:** Frequency × duration is more reliable than gut feeling.

---

## Tactic 6: The Disappearing Task

**When they resist giving any number:**

**You say:**
> "If this task just disappeared tomorrow, how much time would you get back?"

Or:
> "If you didn't have to do this anymore, what would you do with that time?"

**Why it works:** Reframes from measurement to imagination.

---

## Tactic 7: Best Case / Worst Case

**When they say:** "It really depends..."

**You say:**
> "What's the best case - when everything goes smoothly?"
> "What's the worst case - when everything goes wrong?"
> "What's typical - somewhere in between?"

**Why it works:** Acknowledges variability while still getting data.

---

## Tactic 8: Error-Based Quantification

**When direct time is hard to get:**

**You say:**
> "When this goes wrong, what happens?"
> "How often does that happen - once a week? Once a month?"
> "How long does it take to fix?"

Then calculate error cost:
> "So 2 errors/month × 3 hours to fix = 6 hours/month in rework"

**Why it works:** Errors are memorable, normal tasks aren't.

---

## Tactic 9: The Shadow Day

**When all else fails:**

**You say:**
> "Walk me through what you did yesterday, start to finish."
> "When did you touch this task? For how long?"

Then extrapolate:
> "And yesterday was pretty typical?"

**Why it works:** Narrative is easier than quantification.

---

## Reassurance Phrases

Use these when they hesitate:

- "I don't need exact - rough is fine"
- "We're looking for patterns, not precision"
- "Even a ballpark helps"
- "Order of magnitude - are we talking minutes, hours, or days?"
- "Your best guess is probably pretty good"

---

## Converting Staff Data to Business Value

Staff give you time. You need to convert to money for proposals.

### Time → Cost Formula
```
Annual Hours = Weekly Hours × 52
Cost = Annual Hours × Hourly Rate
```

**Hourly rate estimates:**
- Junior/admin: €20-30/hour
- Mid-level: €35-50/hour
- Senior/specialist: €60-100/hour
- Founder/executive: €100-200/hour (opportunity cost)

### Example
- Staff spends 5 hours/week on invoice validation
- Annual: 5 × 52 = 260 hours
- At €40/hour = €10,400/year
- At founder rate (€150/hour) = €39,000/year opportunity cost

## Quick Reference: Question → Tactic

| They Say | Use This Tactic |
|----------|-----------------|
| "I don't know" | Range anchor |
| "It varies" | Best/worst/typical |
| "It depends" | Count instances |
| "Each one is different" | Specific day |
| "I've never measured" | Disappearing task |
| "Sometimes a lot, sometimes nothing" | Frequency builder |
| "I can't estimate" | Comparison |
| Long pause / resistance | Reassurance + reframe |

---

## What to Capture

At minimum, try to get:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Hours/week on pain point | Even a range |
| Frequency (times per week/month) | |
| Time per instance | |
| Error rate | Even "rarely" vs "often" |
| Rework time when errors occur | |

**One solid number is better than zero numbers.**
