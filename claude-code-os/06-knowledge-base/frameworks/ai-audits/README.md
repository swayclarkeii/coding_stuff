## Core Distinction: CEO vs Staff Interviews

| Aspect | CEO/Owner | Staff |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Focus** | Business problems, ROI, strategy | Daily processes, tools, time |
| **Knows** | Why things matter, budget, goals | How things work, workarounds |
| **Can give** | Revenue impact, cost tolerance | Hours spent, error frequency |
| **Questions** | Pain → Cost → Future → Magic Wand | Tasks → Steps → Tools → Frustrations |
| **Goal** | Business case, budget approval | Process maps, automation targets |

**Rule:** Never ask staff about company revenue or strategic direction. Never ask CEOs to walk you through their spreadsheet formulas.
