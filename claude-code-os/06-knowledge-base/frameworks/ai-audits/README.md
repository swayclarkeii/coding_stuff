# AI Audit Framework

**Location:** General knowledge for all AI audit engagements
**Use:** Interview frameworks, questionnaires, quantification tactics

## The 4 C's (Core Quantification Framework)

**For every pain point, capture these four data points:**

| C | Question | What You Get |
|---|----------|--------------|
| **Count** | How many times per week? | Frequency |
| **Clock** | How long does each one take? | Duration |
| **Consequence** | What happens when it goes wrong? | Error impact |
| **Chain** | Who else is affected? | Ripple effect |

**Count × Clock = Time Spent**
**Consequence + Chain = Business Impact**

*This framework applies to both CEO and Staff interviews.*

## Core Distinction: CEO vs Staff Interviews

| Aspect | CEO/Owner | Staff |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Focus** | Business problems, ROI, strategy | Daily processes, tools, time |
| **Knows** | Why things matter, budget, goals | How things work, workarounds |
| **Can give** | Revenue impact, cost tolerance | Hours spent, error frequency |
| **Questions** | Pain → Cost → Future → Magic Wand | Tasks → Steps → Tools → Frustrations |
| **Goal** | Business case, budget approval | Process maps, automation targets |

**Rule:** Never ask staff about company revenue or strategic direction. Never ask CEOs to walk you through their spreadsheet formulas.

## Typical Engagement Flow

### Phase 1: CEO Discovery (1 call)
- Top of Mind framework (pain, cost, future, magic wand)
- Business context, goals, constraints
- Identify which staff to interview
- **Output:** Business case, pain points, scope

### Phase 2: Staff Audits (3-5 calls)
- Process mapping per role
- Tools and data flow
- Quantification (time, frequency, errors)
- **Output:** Workflow maps, automation targets, COI data

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Proposal
- Combine CEO pain with staff process data
- Calculate ROI using quantified data
- Build proposal with quick wins matrix
