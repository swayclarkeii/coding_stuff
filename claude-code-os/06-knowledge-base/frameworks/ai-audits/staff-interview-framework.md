# Staff Interview Framework

**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Purpose:** Map processes, quantify time, identify automation targets
**Key Difference from CEO:** Focus on HOW work gets done, not WHY it matters to the business

## Time Structure

| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| 1. Setup | 0-3 min | Context, consent, rapport |
| 2. Role Overview | 3-10 min | Typical week walkthrough |
| 3. Pain Points | 10-18 min | Frustrations and time sinks |
| 4. Process Deep-Dive | 18-35 min | Step-by-step workflow mapping |
| 5. Quantification | 35-42 min | Hours, frequency, errors |
| 6. Wrap-Up | 42-45 min | Quick wins, anything missed |

---

## Phase 1: Setup (3 min)

### Opening Script
> "Thanks for taking the time. I'm talking to the team to understand how work actually flows day-to-day. This isn't a performance review - I want to find the boring, repetitive stuff that steals your time so we can fix it. There are no wrong answers."

### Consent
> "I'm recording for notes. Is that OK? Your input stays confidential - this is about systems, not people."

### Rapport Question
- "How's your week going?"
- "What's kept you busy?"

---

## Phase 2: Role Overview (7 min)

### Main Question
> "Walk me through a typical week in your role. What do you do on Monday morning, and how does your week flow from there?"

### Follow-Up Probes
| Probe | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| "What triggers that?" | Find input sources |
| "Then what happens?" | Map sequence |
| "Who do you hand it to?" | Find dependencies |
| "How do you know when it's done?" | Find completion criteria |

### Capture
Note each distinct activity and its frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/ad-hoc)

---

## Phase 3: Pain Points (8 min)

### Staff-Appropriate Questions

**NOT:** "What's costing the business money?"
**YES:** "What frustrates you most about your daily work?"

| Question | What You're Getting |
|----------|---------------------|
| "What task do you dread doing?" | Emotional pain point |
| "What takes way longer than it should?" | Time sink |
| "What do you have to do over and over?" | Repetitive task |
| "Where do things get stuck or lost?" | Process breakdown |
| "What makes you think 'there has to be a better way'?" | Automation opportunity |

### Drill-Down
When they mention a pain point:
> "Tell me more about that. What happened last time?"

---

## Phase 4: Process Deep-Dive (17 min)

### Setup
Pick the biggest pain point from Phase 3 and map it step-by-step.

> "Let's walk through [PAIN POINT TASK] like I'm shadowing you. What's the very first thing you do?"

### Step-by-Step Questions
For each step, ask:
1. "What do you click/open first?"
2. "Where does that information come from?"
3. "What tool are you in?"
4. "What do you do with it?"
5. "Where does it go next?"
6. "Then what?"

### Capture Template
| Step | Action | Input Source | Tool | Output | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |

### Tools Inventory
> "What apps do you have open right now? What tabs?"

Note: Browser tabs, desktop apps, communication tools

### Data Flow
> "Where does the data start, and where does it need to end up?"

Look for: Copy-paste between systems, manual data entry, waiting on information

---

## Phase 5: Quantification (7 min)

### Direct Questions (Try First)

| Question | Target Data |
|----------|-------------|
| "How many hours per week do you spend on [TASK]?" | Weekly hours |
| "How many times per week does this happen?" | Frequency |
| "How long does each one take?" | Per-instance time |
| "How often does something go wrong?" | Error rate |

### When They Say "I Don't Know" - Quantification Tactics

**Tactic 1: Anchor with a range**
> "Is it closer to 1 hour or 10 hours per week?"
Then narrow: "So between 3-5 hours?"

**Tactic 2: Work backwards from a specific day**
> "Think about last Tuesday. How much time did you spend on this?"
> "Is last Tuesday typical, or was it more/less than usual?"

**Tactic 3: Count instances**
> "How many [invoices/emails/requests] did you process last week?"
> "How long does each one take, roughly?"
Then calculate: instances × time per instance

**Tactic 4: Compare to something known**
> "Does this take longer than your morning coffee, or less?"
> "Is it a 5-minute task or a 30-minute task?"

**Tactic 5: Use frequency to estimate**
> "Do you do this daily, weekly, or monthly?"
> "How many times per [day/week]?"
Then: frequency × duration = total time

### When They Say "It Depends"

> "Give me the best case and worst case."
> "What's a typical one like, not the crazy exceptions?"

### When They Resist Giving Numbers

> "I don't need exact - a rough estimate is fine. We're looking for patterns, not precision."

Or reframe:
> "If this task disappeared tomorrow, how much time would you get back?"

### Error Impact Questions

| Question | What You're Getting |
|----------|---------------------|
| "What happens when this goes wrong?" | Downstream impact |
| "How often does that happen?" | Error frequency |
| "How long does it take to fix?" | Rework time |
| "Who else has to deal with it?" | Ripple effect |

---

## Phase 6: Wrap-Up (3 min)

### Quick Win Question
> "If I could fix ONE thing in your workflow tomorrow, what would make the biggest difference?"

### Anything Missed
> "Is there anything else about your work that we didn't cover?"

### Close
> "This is really helpful. Can I follow up if I have questions?"

---

## Post-Interview Checklist

### Immediately (5 min)
- [ ] Note top 3 pain points
- [ ] Note biggest time sink (hours/week)
- [ ] Flag any follow-up questions

### Within 24 Hours
- [ ] Review Fathom transcript
- [ ] Extract key quotes
- [ ] Complete workflow map
- [ ] Calculate: Weekly hours × 52 = Annual hours on task

---

## Quantification Quick Reference

### Time Calculation
```
Weekly Time = (Instances/Week) × (Minutes/Instance)
Monthly Time = Weekly × 4.33
Annual Time = Weekly × 52
```

### Cost of Inaction (Staff Data)
Staff can't give you revenue impact, but they can give you:
- Hours spent (convert to cost using average salary later)
- Error frequency
- Rework time
- Delays caused

The CEO interview gives you the "what this costs the business" context.

---

## Red Flags to Note

| They Say | You Think |
|----------|-----------|
| "I just know how to do it" | Undocumented process (risk if they leave) |
| "It depends on..." | Decision logic to capture |
| "We don't have a system for that" | Automation opportunity |
| "I copy from X and paste into Y" | Integration opportunity |
| "I have to chase people for..." | Notification/reminder opportunity |
| Long pause + sigh | High frustration = priority target |

---

## What NOT to Ask Staff

- "What's this costing the company?" (They don't know)
- "What's the strategic priority?" (Not their domain)
- "What's your budget for this?" (Ask the CEO)
- "If nothing changes, what happens to the business?" (Ask the CEO)

**Keep it grounded in their daily experience.**
