AI AUDIT INTERVIEW GUIDE

What to expect and how to prepare

────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT IS THIS?

We're mapping your workflows to find hidden time sinks — repetitive tasks stealing hours from your week. Think building inspection before renovations.

────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU

1. Quantify time — Not "takes a while." We need:
   "4 hours per client pulling data from 5 platforms"

2. Show real workflows — Screen share the actual process, not the sanitized version.

3. Be honest — Tell us about work-arounds, bottlenecks, and "we've always done it this way" processes.

────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Replacing jobs       → Saving you hours for higher-value work
Blame game           → System problems, not people problems
Performance review   → Discovery, not evaluation

────────────────────────────────────────

WHAT THIS IS

Saving time. Reducing frustration. Fixing what's broken.

CONFIDENTIALITY

Calls are recorded for notes only. Your input is anonymized — like a doctor-patient conversation.

Let's find some wins together.
