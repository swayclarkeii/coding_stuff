## Core Principles

### 1. The Entropy Principle
**99% can be imperfect.**

Accept that most things don't need to be perfect. Focus your perfectionism on the 1% that truly matters. For Oloxa.ai, that 1% is:
- Client deliverables
- Key relationships
- Core systems

### 2. Zero Friction
**Remove barriers to action.**

If something is hard to do, you won't do it consistently. Make your systems:
- Fast to use (<5 min for daily planning)
- Easy to access (everything in one place)
- Simple to understand (no complex processes)

### 3. The Spartan Rule
**Lean operations.**

Don't build infrastructure you don't need yet. Stay light and agile:
- Minimum viable systems
- Add complexity only when necessary
- Delete what you don't use

### 4. Strategic Alignment
**Every action serves the main objective.**

Before any task, ask: "Does this move Oloxa.ai toward my goals?"
- 5 clients by end of 2025
- $5K/month by May 6
- YouTube channel launch

If it doesn't align, question whether to do it.

## The Oloxa.ai Operating Philosophy

### Sales First
Revenue solves most problems. Prioritize:
1. Closing deals
2. Delivering for clients
3. Everything else

### Build in Public
Your journey IS your content. Document:
- What you're learning
- Challenges you face
- Wins you achieve

### Family Integration
Two kids and a wife aren't obstacles - they're priorities:
- Protect family time
- Sustainable pace > sprint and crash
- Build a business that serves life, not consumes it

### Client Success = Your Success
Happy clients bring:
- Testimonials
- Referrals
- Case studies
- Recurring revenue

## Key Frameworks

### The Tier System (Daily Planning)
- **Tier 1:** Must do - non-negotiable
- **Tier 2:** Should do - important but flexible
- **Tier 3:** Could do - if time permits

### The One Thing
Each day, identify the single task that would move the needle most. Everything else is secondary.

### 80/20 Rule
20% of activities produce 80% of results. Find your 20%:
- Which clients bring most value?
- Which activities close deals?
- Which work creates testimonials?

## Decision-Making Guide

When unsure what to do, ask in order:

1. **Does it make money?** (Revenue activities first)
2. **Does it keep a promise?** (Client commitments)
3. **Does it build the future?** (Systems, content, relationships)
4. **Can it wait?** (If yes, it probably should)
