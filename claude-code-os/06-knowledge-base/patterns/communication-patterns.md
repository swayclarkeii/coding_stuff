## Individual Patterns

### Detailed Workflow Walkthroughs Reveal Hidden Opportunities (Added: 2024-12-10)
**Context:** Discovery calls with clients who have established processes
**Finding:** When you ask clients to walk through their current workflow step-by-step (not just high-level pain points), they reveal automation opportunities they didn't initially mention. The act of explaining the process out loud helps them identify friction points. Specific questions like "then what do you do next?" uncover tedious manual steps they've normalized.
**Action:** In discovery calls, dedicate 30-40% of time to workflow walkthrough. Ask: "Walk me through what happens from [start] to [end], step by step." Follow up with: "How long does that take?" and "Do you have to do this for every [transaction/client/order]?" Take notes on time spent per step.
**Evidence:** A Mother's Touch - Initial pain point was "admin help needed." Detailed walkthrough revealed: 15-30 min quote generation, copy/paste terms every time, manual vendor coordination, spam folder checks, etc. These specific details weren't mentioned until workflow discussion.
**Validation:** Single-project (standard discovery practice, needs conscious application tracking)

### Clients Who Articulate "Why" Behind Preferences Are Easier to Serve (Added: 2024-12-10)
**Context:** Discovery calls where clients explain not just what they want, but why they want it
**Finding:** Clients who naturally explain their reasoning (not just state preferences) give you the context needed to design better solutions. They help you understand constraints, fears, past experiences, and success criteria. This leads to proposals that address root causes, not just surface requests.
**Action:** If client states a preference without context, always ask: "Why is that important to you?" or "What led you to that approach?" Listen for phrases like "I tried X before and..." or "When customers do Y, I've noticed..." Document these insights separately from requirements.
**Evidence:** A Mother's Touch - Nicole explained why she moved to forms: social media messages disappear, conversations get lost, no paper trail. She explained why she itemizes invoices: "when they don't get the breakdown, I get bombarded with questions." This "why" context informed solution design.
**Validation:** Single-project (general best practice, track consciously)

### Let Clients Complain Before Solving (Added: 2024-12-10)
**Context:** Discovery calls where consultant is eager to jump to solutions
**Finding:** The more time you let clients describe their frustrations (without interrupting with solutions), the more complete picture you get. Clients often minimize pain points initially ("it's fine, just annoying") but reveal true impact when given space to elaborate. Premature solution-offering cuts off valuable context.
**Action:** In first 60% of discovery call, use prompts like: "Tell me more about that," "What else?" "How does that affect your day?" Resist urge to say "I can fix that" until you've heard everything. Take "pain point inventory" before discussing solutions.
**Evidence:** A Mother's Touch - Call structure allowed extensive pain point sharing. Nicole revealed: losing customers, missing spam inquiries, budget mismatches, vendor delays, and more. Each complaint built on previous one, creating comprehensive picture. If solutions were offered early, later pain points might not have surfaced.
**Validation:** Single-project (standard discovery practice, needs intentional application)
