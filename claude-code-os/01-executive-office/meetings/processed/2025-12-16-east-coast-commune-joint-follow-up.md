# East Coast Commune - Joint Follow-Up Meeting
## Derek & Jenna Partnership Session

**Date:** December 16, 2025
**Time:** 12:30 PM - 1:45 PM (61 minutes)
**Attendees:** Sway Clarke (Consultant), Derek (Co-owner), Jenna (Co-owner)
**Meeting Type:** Follow-up / Partnership Alignment Session
**Recording:** https://fathom.video/share/y4kLQ7sxdT4A5mzzEU1pDn7UyMM25DiV

## Executive Summary

**What This Meeting Was Supposed To Be:** A follow-up session to align on priorities after separate discovery calls with each partner, review proposed solutions (Dashboard, Accounting, Catering), and establish next steps.

**What This Meeting Actually Became:** A partnership therapy session that exposed fundamental communication breakdowns, mismatched work styles, and deep frustration on both sides. The meeting revealed that the technical solutions (dashboard, tools, automation) are secondary to the core issue: **Derek and Jenna have incompatible working styles and no formal systems to bridge the gap.**

### Critical Findings

1. **The Real Problem:** This isn't about needing better tools - it's about needing basic communication infrastructure and aligned expectations between partners
2. **Work Style Mismatch:**
   - **Derek:** Idea generator, high-level thinker, expects people to "figure it out" with minimal direction
   - **Jenna:** Detail-oriented executor, needs specific instructions and structure to work effectively
3. **Zero Formal Systems:** No documented processes, no shared task management, everything lives "in Derek's head"
4. **Partnership Tension:** Derek feels Jenna lacks initiative; Jenna feels Derek withholds necessary information
5. **Business Risk:** Without addressing these fundamental issues, any technical solutions will fail

## Meeting Flow & Key Moments

### Opening: Time Management Discussion (5:00-6:00)

**Context Check:**
- Sway asked if they'd discussed priorities since their individual discovery calls
- **Jenna:** "Our conversations on a daily basis sort of are based on that... it wasn't specifically like 'we need to do this because Sway asked us to'"

**Reality:** They haven't formally aligned on priorities but these issues come up constantly.

---

### The Slack Conversation: First Warning Sign (6:00-11:00)

**Derek's Perspective:**
- Used to use Slack with previous partnerships
- Liked it because: "I can go a mile a minute, do 10 different things at once"
- Could organize categories (marketing, operations, etc.) and people could view at leisure
- **Quote:** "I like that because it's like... I put it all in there and add as I go and people just kind of look"

**Jenna's Perspective:**
- Didn't like Slack: **"For me it was confusing because there was too many things happening"**
- Her brain works differently than Derek's
- Needs more structure and compartmentalization

**Critical Moment (10:29):**
> **Jenna:** "Sometimes [Derek] doesn't explain everything, so he could lay it all out. Because sometimes like if we have say catering, he'll just be like, 'we need to do catering.' But in his brain, he knows we need to do the menus, we need to do the marketing, need to do da da da da da, but all he says is 'catering.' And then we're supposed to decipher what that's about."

**Sway's Insight:** "Derek has something in his head, and then everybody else is trying to figure out what's in his head."

---

### The Core Dynamic Revealed (11:00-22:00)

#### Derek's Expectations

**Quote (11:19):**
> "I have so many things going on... I don't have time to walk you through every little step. If you don't know, ask me and I'll tell you, but I don't have time to walk you through every little step."

**Quote (18:30):**
> "I expect people that are in what we're doing to have a passion or initiative to be like, to want to do it... I want people that just want to do it, and will think of 'okay, well, maybe I should do this, or do this, or call this, or blah, blah, blah.'"

**Derek's Frustration:**
- Feels he shouldn't have to explain everything multiple times
- Expects partners to take initiative and "figure it out"
- Wants people who are equally driven to "make shit happen"
- **Quote:** "I don't have time always to say, okay, well, I think I want a candle that's this big and this scent... I just need people to start things"

#### Jenna's Frustration

**Quote (17:05):**
> "I have to decipher everything that Derek's saying because he doesn't give the information. I'm the type of person where he can be like, 'hey, let's make products' and then go. I want to be like, 'okay, what products are we making?' So then I can research that... I want more information from the beginning."

**Jenna's Needs:**
- Clear direction before starting work
- Doesn't want to waste time researching things that might not align with Derek's vision
- Works better with a template or structure to follow
- Prefers pen and paper, will use any system as long as it's user-friendly

---

### "Are You Charging Us for Therapy?" (16:30)

**Context:** As the discussion got deeper into their working dynamics, Jenna interrupted:

> **Jenna:** "Are you charging us for therapy as well?"

**This marked the shift** from a business consulting call to a partnership counseling session.

---

### Derek's "No Hand-Holding" Philosophy (23:00-24:45)

**Quote (23:00):**
> **Derek:** "Sometimes I don't care... I don't care about feelings and what people think. Sometimes, sometimes, no, it's like, I have, there's a job to do, and we have to get it done. There's no excuses. There's no hand-holding. There's nothing like that. It's like, you have a job to do. Get it done. I don't care if you're feeling this. I don't care if you're that. You're at work. Get the job done, right? Or don't work. Or don't do it."

**Derek's Rationale:**
- Taking time to explain/support takes away from keeping the business afloat
- Wants people who are "with it and down" rather than needing emotional support
- **Jenna's role:** "That's your role to talk to people and make them feel good"

**Jenna's Response:**
- Agrees there are things she can do on her own
- But she needs more initial information to be effective
- The "people" Derek is talking about is mostly just... Jenna

---

### Sway's Intervention (25:00-28:30)

**Key Points:**

1. **Reality Check:**
   > "You're not hiring anybody anytime soon... So that kind of means you got to work with what you have, in a way, right? You have to work with the people you have, you have to work with the personalities that you have."

2. **Leadership Perspective:**
   > "Really good leaders are also very clear. And they're also able to be clear with different types of people because when you run these big companies, you have many different executives that are under you... The key is to find out how these people tick and then figure out how you need to communicate to them."

3. **Efficiency Argument:**
   > "If you spend an extra five minutes or two minutes to communicate what it is you need or what it is you're looking for a little bit more clearly, potentially you could get the output that you want a little bit more faster and a little bit more effective."

4. **The Cost of Poor Communication:**
   > "If you got to talk to Jenna three or four times over the course of a month about the same thing, then it's not very efficient. It means that whatever you communicated didn't communicate properly. And it should be that it communicates one time. And then Jenna can go off like she doesn't need to come back."

---

### The "Writing Things Down" Breakthrough (28:45-29:20)

**Jenna's Example:**
> "We did that the other day. Derek started spewing a bunch of things. I said, 'hold on, I need to write this down.' And he's like, 'no, it's just constant. It's always going to be there.' And I said, 'no, because I need to write it down or else I'm not going to get it done.'"

**Result:**
> "I wrote my list down, and already this morning, I'm looking at it thinking, okay, I can call them, I can get this information, I can do all of that, whereas before, if I hadn't have written it down, and it was just a conversation, it would be exactly the same, where I would not remember to do it, or I would put it at the bottom of the list, and then Derek would get frustrated later on."

**This is THE solution** - but Derek resisted it initially.

---

### Derek Wants More Initiative from Jenna (30:00-32:00)

**Derek's Expectation:**
> "In your own business, there's gotta be things in the business that you can see that say you need to improve, you need to introduce, need to implement... There's so many things that, like, I don't need to tell you anything, there'll be things that I need to work on, but there's also things that I think you, as a partner in business, should be coming up with or implementing or researching or doing yourself."

**The Contradiction:**
- Derek wants Jenna to take initiative and come to him with ideas
- But Jenna's brain doesn't work that way - she needs direction first, then she executes brilliantly
- Derek is looking for another version of himself: someone who generates ideas AND executes

---

### Sway's Clarification (32:00-34:00)

**On Interest vs. Skill Set:**
> "I wouldn't use the word interest. I don't think that Jenna is not interested in making this business work... That's a different skill set. That's a different thing. Some people have that, some people don't have that. And that's totally fine. You have that. You're able to look at the business constantly every day and be like, okay, fine. Oh, there's something over there. Something over there. And Jenna's not able to do that. She doesn't do it the same way."

**The Key Question:**
> "What could potentially equip Jenna to be able to do that? How could Jenna see these things a bit more clearly, or see them, or acknowledge them, and then being able to brainstorm ideas around them?"

## The Christmas Candle Project: Case Study in Failure

*(This portion of the transcript was cut off but the Fathom summary captured it)*

**The Project:**
- Derek suggested selling candles for Christmas
- Jenna focused on making the candles
- Derek worked on logo and branding

**The Breakdown:**
- A launch date was mentioned (October/November) but never confirmed
- No central location for tracking the deadline
- Project missed its launch window entirely

**Root Cause:**
- No shared project plan
- No single source of truth
- Everything living "in Derek's head"

**Quote from Summary:**
> "The lack of a clear, shared project plan meant neither partner could track progress against a common goal."

---

## Proposed Solution (From Meeting Discussion)

**The System:**
1. Externalize Derek's ideas into a structured format
2. Create a single source of truth for all projects and tasks
3. Example mechanism: Derek records audio notes → AI extracts key points → Shared board (Kanban) is populated with prioritized tasks

**Outcome:**
- Provides clarity Jenna needs to execute independently
- Frees Derek from repetitive explanations
- Creates accountability and transparency

---

## Sway's Assessment

### What I Observed

**Partnership Dynamics:**
- This is a **classic visionary/executor mismatch** without the systems to bridge the gap
- Derek generates ideas at a rate that overwhelms Jenna
- Jenna needs structure and detail that Derek doesn't naturally provide
- Both are frustrated and feeling unsupported

**The Real Issue:**
- NOT that they need a dashboard, Expensify, or social media tools
- NOT that Jenna lacks initiative or Derek lacks communication skills
- The issue is: **They have no formal systems to translate Derek's vision into Jenna's actionable tasks**

**Business Risk:**
- If they don't address this, they will continue to miss deadlines, duplicate work, and create friction
- The new venue opening will amplify these problems exponentially
- Any technical solution I build will fail without fixing this foundation

### The "People" Problem

**A Critical Observation:**
- Throughout the meeting, Derek kept saying "people need to just figure it out"
- But there are no "people" - it's just Derek and Jenna
- Derek is talking about Jenna when he says "people"
- This creates a power dynamic issue: Derek is the boss giving orders, not partners collaborating

**Jenna's Insight:**
> "When he talks about people, it obviously shows that we need people to help. Because the people is me and him."

## What This Means for the Project

### The Honest Truth

**Should I Take This Project?**

**Arguments Against:**
1. **This isn't a tech problem** - It's a partnership/counseling problem that's outside my expertise
2. **High emotional stakes** - Any system I build will become a battleground for their existing conflicts
3. **Unrealistic expectations from Derek** - He wants Jenna to work differently than she's capable of
4. **Lack of mutual respect** - Derek's "I don't care about feelings" approach is concerning
5. **They need a mediator, not a consultant** - This is couples therapy for business partners

**Arguments For:**
1. **They genuinely need help** - Left unaddressed, this business will struggle
2. **Clear technical solution exists** - A shared task management system could help enormously
3. **Both are committed** - Despite friction, both are working hard and want success
4. **The writing-things-down breakthrough** - There's evidence they CAN work together with the right infrastructure
5. **I have the skills** - This is exactly what my process automation + coaching background is for

### My Recommendation

**If I proceed, this needs to be a TWO-PART engagement:**

**Part 1: Partnership Infrastructure (6-8 weeks)**
- Establish communication protocols
- Build shared task management system
- Create "Derek idea → Jenna execution" workflow
- Set up regular alignment meetings
- Document all processes

**Part 2: Technical Solutions (4-6 weeks each)**
- Only after Part 1 is working
- Dashboard → Expensify → Social Media (in that order)

**Key Boundaries:**
- I am a consultant, not a marriage counselor
- Both partners must commit to using new systems
- Derek must commit to writing down/recording ideas with detail
- Jenna must commit to asking clarifying questions upfront

**Alternative:**
- Recommend they work with a business coach/mediator first
- Revisit technical solutions after they've aligned on working relationship
- I could return in 3-6 months when they're ready

---

## Next Steps from Meeting

**From Fathom Summary:**

**Derek:**
- Adopt a system to externalize ideas into a structured format (e.g., audio notes, shared board)
- Create a single source of truth for project deadlines and details

**Jenna:**
- Use the new system to create detailed task lists and execute projects independently

**Both:**
- Use the Christmas candle project as a pilot to test the new communication and execution system

## Quotes That Sum It All Up

**On the core problem:**
> **Jenna:** "He has all of those things in his brain and sometimes he doesn't explain everything... all he says is 'catering' and then we're supposed to decipher what that's about."

**On expectations:**
> **Derek:** "I expect people that just want to do it... I don't have time to walk you through every little step."

**On working styles:**
> **Jenna:** "My brain doesn't work at all like Derek's... I want more information from the beginning so then I can put the time and not waste time researching something that he thinks is a terrible idea."

**On the solution:**
> **Sway:** "Really good leaders are also very clear... The key is to find out how these people tick and then figure out how you need to communicate to them."

## Personal Notes (Sway)

- This was emotionally intense
- Both partners are clearly exhausted and frustrated
- I felt more like a mediator than a consultant
- The Jenna "therapy" comment wasn't entirely a joke
- Derek's "I don't care about feelings" comment is a red flag
- Need to seriously consider if this is a project I want to take on
- The technical solutions are easy - the human dynamics are hard
- This could either be incredibly rewarding (help save a partnership) or incredibly draining (get stuck in the middle of ongoing conflict)

**Question for myself:** Am I equipped to handle the partnership counseling this requires? Or should I refer them to someone who specializes in business partnership mediation?
