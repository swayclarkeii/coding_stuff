## Executive Summary

**What This Meeting Was About:** Follow-up after initial discovery to see where Jennifer and Steve landed on focus areas.

**What We Discovered:** The real problem isn't needing AI tools or automation - it's that **they have no customer journey**. People enter their ecosystem through various touchpoints (Instagram, one-on-ones, corporate events) and then fall off a cliff with nowhere to go next.

**Major Breakthrough:** All roads should lead to Sedona retreats. Everything else (corporate events, Instagram, one-on-ones, podcast) should funnel into the core product: in-person transformational retreats.

**Next Steps:** Jennifer and Steve need to map the complete customer journey from first touchpoint → Sedona → post-Sedona integration, THEN Sway can help with communication systems.

## Key Findings

### 1. The "Too Wide" Problem

**Current State:**
- **Pause & Expand** (corporate clients) - Steve does corporate sound baths
- **Jennifer Spencer Medium** (individual clients) - Jen does one-on-one readings
- Sedona retreats (20 people, 3-day transformational experience)
- Podcast, Instagram content, community events
- No clear connection between all these pieces

**Steve's Realization:**
> "We're trying to do too much. And with the people that are already bought in, we're not doing enough. We're not coming up with enough ideas for them."

**The Problem:**
- Wide audience = diluted focus
- Corporate vs. individual = completely different markets
- Can't do everything well
- Leaving money on the table with existing customers

### 2. The Missing Customer Journey

**Jen's Observation:**
> "There's this massive group of people that when they come to me, they're like, 'I want to start a spiritual business and I don't know how to do it.' They have no place to go beyond these one-on-ones that I'm doing."

**Current Reality:**
- People do a one-on-one reading → gone (maybe come back in 3 months)
- People attend Sedona retreat → nothing to offer them after
- International clients can't get to Sedona → no virtual alternative
- Corporate clients are separate ecosystem → not integrated

**Jen's Quote:**
> "After Sedona, they're going to love us even more. So then what do we do with that? We have nothing to offer them."

**Sway's Diagnosis:**
> "You're basically losing the customer's journey. Customer journey is not there. There is no customer journey."

### 3. The Sedona-Centric Solution

**Sway's Proposed Framework:**

**Make everything point to Sedona:**
- Instagram content → promotes Sedona
- One-on-one readings → funnel to Sedona
- Corporate events → promote Sedona
- Podcast → drives Sedona signups
- Everything centers on one core product

**Post-Sedona Path:**
- Integration/implementation course (8 weeks, virtual)
- Upsell in the heat of the moment: "Do you want this ride to end?"
- Sedona Live (in-person) vs. Sedona Online (virtual for international)
- Build testimonial engine: everyone who attends gives video testimonial
- Create scarcity: "Did you make it to Sedona?"

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Current: ~$1,000/person (20 people = $20,000 per retreat)
- Goal: Scale to $5,000-6,000/person
- Build exclusivity and demand first
- Price increases as reputation grows

**The Vision:**
> "Make that retreat be like everybody's like, 'I didn't get in. I need to be there next time.'"

## Strategic Insights from Conversation

### On Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Sway's Advice:**
> "It's easier to keep monetizing someone who's already in the door than keep going and finding new people."

**Current State:**
- Jennifer has audience (one-on-ones, Instagram, retreat attendees)
- Not maximizing value from existing relationships
- People want more, but nothing to offer them

**Opportunity:**
- 15 out of 20 Sedona attendees would likely say yes to 4-week virtual follow-up
- That's $7,000/month additional revenue
- Not heavy lift to service people who already trust you

### On Value-Based Selling vs. "Snake Oil"

**Steve's Concern:**
> "The snake oil salesman approach... We've noticed a lot of coaches with very slick sales campaigns and we're always curious, is this shit even working?"

**Sway's Response:**
> "Everything is sales and marketing. The most prolific thing I've come to understand is: Are you actually providing value to your customers? If that's the case, there's no snake oil salesman. You're providing value."

**The Distinction:**
- If you believe in your service and it changes lives = not snake oil
- If you're selling robot dogs from China = snake oil
- Marketing tactics (scarcity, urgency, price anchoring) are tools
- The question is intention: Are you helping people or exploiting them?

**Examples Referenced:**
- Alex Hormozi: Huge marketing, but provides real value
- Mel Robbins: Every newsletter sells something, but genuinely helps people
- Friend who paid $30K for business coaching: Walked away unsatisfied (red flag)

**Sway's Philosophy:**
> "If you're selling something that you know is going to change your client's life, then you're helping your client. Sometimes people need a push to do that thing."

### On Business Accelerator Idea

**What They Were Considering:**
- Launch business accelerator for coaches/healers/therapists
- Help people start spiritual businesses like theirs
- Niche focus: personal growth space entrepreneurs

**Sway's Caution:**
> "I think this is a different business. That's a different concept. Do you have the capacity to start a different family?"

**The Issue:**
- Business accelerator doesn't funnel into Sedona
- Doesn't pull out of Sedona
- Separate ecosystem = dilutes focus further
- Need to nail Sedona journey first before starting new business

**Recommendation:**
- Wait until Sedona customer journey is dialed in
- First master: How customers enter → Sedona → post-Sedona → repeat
- Then consider expanding to business accelerator as separate vertical

## The Customer Journey Mapping Exercise

### Sway's Framework

**Step 1: Map the Journey**
- Where do people enter? (Instagram, one-on-one, corporate event, podcast)
- What's the next step? (How do they get to Sedona?)
- What happens after Sedona? (Integration course, testimonials, community)
- What builds on each other?
- What references each other?

**Step 2: Make All Roads Lead to Sedona**
- Every touchpoint promotes Sedona
- Every product is pre-Sedona or post-Sedona
- Clear progression path
- No dead ends where people fall off

**Step 3: Ask Customers What They Want**
- Survey retreat attendees: "What do you want after Sedona?"
- Survey one-on-one clients: "What would help you most?"
- Survey international audience: "What's stopping you from Sedona?"
- Let them tell you what to build

**Step 4: Price the Journey**
- How much revenue from one customer over 1 year?
- How much over 3 years?
- What's lifetime value of ideal customer?
- Does the math work to support the business?

**Step 5: Build Communication Systems**
- This is where Sway's automation/AI expertise comes in
- Every touchpoint needs communication
- CTAs at each stage
- Automated follow-ups
- **But can't build this until journey is mapped**

## Sway's Positioning in This Conversation

### What Sway Is NOT Selling

**Early in Call:**
> "I don't really like to call myself an AI business because there's a lot of steps before you implement any system. Most of the time, it's 80% just talking about systems. What are your systems? How do they work?"

**The Truth:**
> "A lot of it is still business consulting. Just trying to figure out what is the real problem, what's the problem you really want to focus on? If you have chaos, then AI will magnify that chaos."

### Where Sway Provides Value

**After Customer Journey is Mapped:**
> "Where I think I could provide some help is how do you communicate with all of these? At every touch point, people need to get some kind of information, some kind of CTA, some kind of goal."

**The Approach:**
1. Jennifer & Steve map customer journey
2. They decide if it makes sense
3. They validate with actual customers
4. THEN Sway builds communication systems to support the journey

**Sway's Philosophy:**
> "The only way that works is when both of us can see the same thing that needs to be optimized and see the value in it, and then we tackle it."

## Key Quotes That Sum It Up

**On Being Too Wide:**
> **Steve:** "We're trying to do too much. And with the people that are already bought in, we're not doing enough."

**On Missing Customer Journey:**
> **Jen:** "After Sedona, they're going to love us even more. So then what do we do with that?"
> **Sway:** "You're basically losing the customer's journey. There is no customer journey."

**On Focus:**
> **Sway:** "I think the question for me would be, do you have the capacity to start a different family? I would just be wary of doing that before you've nailed down the process of Sedona."

**On Value vs. Snake Oil:**
> **Sway:** "If you believe it and it's helping people, then it's not snake oil. But it's a business. There's a part of it that's always going to be a business."

**On Next Steps:**
> **Sway:** "I think you guys should map that out and see if you like it, see if it makes sense, see if it feels good, see if it's something you want to do."

## Project Status Assessment

**Where They Started (Initial Discovery):**
- "We need AI tools and automation"
- "How do we manage Instagram content better?"
- "Should we use Expensify?"

**Where They Are Now:**
- "We need to map our customer journey"
- "We're too wide, need to focus on Sedona"
- "We're leaving money on the table with existing customers"

**What Changed:**
- Shifted from tactical solutions to strategic clarity
- Realized tools won't help until direction is clear
- Recognized need to maximize existing relationships before chasing new ones

**This is GOOD Progress:**
- They're asking the right questions now
- Focus on customer journey = foundation for everything else
- Once journey is mapped, Sway's automation expertise becomes highly valuable

## Sway's Reflection

**What Worked in This Call:**
- Didn't push tools or automation prematurely
- Helped them see the real problem (missing customer journey)
- Gave them framework to work through (map journey → price it → build systems)
- Positioned Sway's value clearly: communication systems AFTER journey is defined

**What This Reveals About Small Business Consulting:**
- Most businesses don't need AI first, they need clarity first
- "Garbage in, garbage out" - chaos + AI = magnified chaos
- 80% of work is understanding systems before implementing anything
- The consultant's job is asking the right questions, not selling solutions

**Key Insight:**
> "This is the process. You don't walk into every meeting and sell something. It's not how it goes."

**Next Meeting Goal:**
- Review their customer journey map
- Validate assumptions with them
- Identify which communication touchpoints to automate first
- Only then discuss specific tools/solutions
