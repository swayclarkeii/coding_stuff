# Meeting Notes - East Coast Commune Discovery Call (Derek)
**Date:** 2025-12-02
**Type:** Discovery Call
**Client:** Derek
**Company:** East Coast Commune (Bar, Restaurant & Catering)
**Attendees:** Derek (Co-owner), Sway Clarke (Consultant)

---

## Executive Summary

Derek is co-owner of East Coast Commune with his partner Jenna, operating a bar/restaurant with catering services in Nova Scotia. Primary pain point: **Social media and marketing content creation consuming 2-3 hours DAILY**. Secondary issues include inventory management (no system for tracking stock levels or reordering), accounting/receipt management (receipts stacked for weeks/months), and lead management for catering/booking requests. Business grossing ~$200K/year with ~$30K take-home. Derek's main motivation: reclaim personal time, not work more. Catering business is "killing it" and growing rapidly, but lacks systems to support scale. Currently using Clover POS (wants to switch to Square), abandoned QuickBooks, now doing manual Excel accounting.

---

## Key Pain Points Identified

### 1. Social Media & Marketing Content Creation (HIGHEST PRIORITY - DEREK)
**Problem:** Daily content creation consuming 2-3 hours per day

**Current Process:**
- Constant scrolling, searching, saving, tagging, liking on social media
- Finding bands, sharing content, engaging with audience
- Creating posts for Facebook AND Instagram (different content for each)
- "All day process" - whenever on phone, spends 5-10 minutes going down rabbit holes
- Previously posting daily, now less due to time constraints

**Time Investment:**
- **2-3 hours PER DAY** minimum
- All day when considering cumulative micro-sessions

**Impact:**
- Primary driver of customer awareness: "A lot of people haven't been to our place yet, but they're like, oh I see what you're doing, it's great"
- Social media is how people discover them
- Critical for getting people in doors
- Drives brand awareness even when bar isn't busy

**Derek's Quote:**
> "My day is pretty much get up, emails from the business, reservations, the bands want to play, then building, dealing with the trades... Marketing, cake, got to go on social media and figure out what's the marketing general would be like."

**Previous Attempt - Blaze AI:**
- Used 2-week trial
- Generated daily content, images, captions automatically
- Issue 1: Watermarked "Posted by Blaze AI" on Facebook - looked inauthentic
- Issue 2: Content too polished, too perfect - "didn't look like us"
- Issue 3: Same content posted to Facebook and Instagram - Derek wanted different content per platform
- Abandoned because "it's just not me, it's not real, it looks too polished"
- Never explored if watermark could be removed or branding customized
- Never tested if content could be customized per platform

**Derek's Ideal Solution:**
- Content that matches their authentic brand voice
- Different content for each platform (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok)
- Reduce time from 2-3 hours/day to minimal oversight
- Appears to come from them, not AI-generated
- Quick to implement - can type prompts and get results

**Strategic Importance:**
> "That continues to drive, if not people into the bar, people following us on social media and still being aware of us... If someone was doing that, then I could take my time and say I'll spend half an hour."

### 2. Inventory Management System (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** No system for tracking stock, knowing when to reorder, or buying in bulk

**Current State:**
- **Reactive ordering:** "We run out of beer, let's go get beer"
- No tracking of consumption rates or patterns
- Buy when items run out rather than proactively stocking
- Don't know average usage rates per item
- Can't anticipate needs based on calendar events
- Communication gaps between staff and owners on inventory

**Example Scenario:**
- Derek preps Thursday, stocks for the week
- Friday: Another staff member works, sells out of jerk chicken or limes
- Staff doesn't communicate depletion
- Derek arrives Saturday: "Where are the limes?"
- Scramble to replace, sometimes resulting in duplicate orders

**What's Missing:**
- System to say: "On average, you go through a case every two weeks, so you should buy for the month, buy two cases"
- Calendar integration: "According to your calendar you have these many events, so you should stock up"
- Reorder alerts: "You're getting low, you only have 10 containers left, oh cool, we need to order 10 containers"
- Consumption tracking by item
- Staff communication about depleted items

**Catering Complication:**
- Regular bar needs: predictable quantities
- Catering orders: variable and large quantities
- Example: Usually buy 1 pack of buns at Costco ($5), but catering order needs 25 packs
- Forces research: "Where can we find these buns in that quantity and size?"
- Need different sizes of containers for different event types
- Must stock specialty items (charcuterie cups, different chicken cuts)

**Time Impact:**
- Not huge when done, but unpredictable scrambles waste time
- Duplicate purchases from lack of communication
- Emergency runs for depleted items
- Research time for bulk catering needs

**Derek's Quote:**
> "There's no system to say, oh, we bought a case of this, it's running low, we should order a case of this at this time, so we know in two weeks we'll have to order again."

**Why No System Exists:**
> "No time to implement one. There's no time and no one to spearhead that department. There's no kitchen manager or food and beverage supervisor."

### 3. Price Comparison & Sourcing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Can't comparison shop across suppliers due to time constraints

**Current Approach:**
- Default to Costco (know it's cheap) + local grocery store (convenience)
- 5 potential sources: Costco, 2 grocery stores, 2 food service providers, 1 market
- Sometimes check flyers for sales, but inconsistently
- Small town with limited options

**Ideal Solution:**
- "This week we're buying our chicken from here because it's cheaper"
- Automated price comparison across suppliers
- Alert when items are on sale
- Bulk vs single purchase decision support

**Current Reality:**
- Not doing price comparison because "we still don't have time to do it"
- Just buying from Costco or closest store
- Don't even know what other prices could be
- When catering needs change (different quantities), forced to research suppliers

**Time Investment:**
- Not tracked, but significant when done manually
- Multiple flyers to review
- Calling suppliers for specialty items
- Unknown ROI on time spent

**Derek's Quote:**
> "I would love to be able to say, okay, this week we're buying our chicken from here because it's cheaper... sometimes there are sales and sometimes you try to go through all the flyers."

### 4. Accounting & Receipt Management (HIGH PRIORITY - JENNA'S DOMAIN)
**Problem:** No organized system for receipt tracking and expense management

**Current State:**
- Physical receipts "just stacked" for weeks or months
- Jenna does manual Excel entry
- Abandoned QuickBooks (didn't integrate with Clover POS)
- Manual tracking of taxes and HST
- No real-time financial visibility

**Derek's Quote:**
> "I don't think we have appropriate accounting. We're just doing it, like she just has an Excel file, creates it, goes to the receipts manually, does all the taxes and HST, all that, she just does it manually."

**Impact:**
- Jenna's pain point (see separate call notes)
- Blocks real-time financial decision-making
- Accumulation causes stress
- Year-end scramble

**Derek's Assessment:**
> "I think on her side it's the accounting, getting receipts and invoices and quotes... The receipts come in, it's got to be filed somewhere, put into a system of sorts, but we don't have anything for that."

### 5. Lead Management & Request Fielding (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Manual handling of booking requests, catering inquiries, band submissions

**Current Flow - General Inquiries:**
1. Request comes to info@eastcoastcommune
2. Derek or Jenna receives email
3. Manual back-and-forth: What kind of music? What date? Equipment needs? Band lineup?
4. Can't reply through HubSpot form - must copy email, create new email
5. Uncertainty: Will reply go to their junk folder?
6. Derek forwards catering requests to Jenna
7. Tracking gets lost - "I don't see the email for like two weeks later"

**Current Flow - Catering (Jenna's Domain):**
- Request → Qualifying questions → Menu selection → Quote → Invoice
- 15-20 minutes per lead (see Jenna's call notes)
- Growing volume: "We're killing it with catering"

**What's Missing:**
- **Phone system:** "We have a telephone number, but we're not always there and there's no answering machine"
- **AI phone assistant:** Derek interested in system where customers can call, explain what they need, AI gathers information and forwards to team
- **Email separation:** Should have separate emails for catering@, booking@, reservations@, events@
- **Auto-qualification:** System to ask basic questions before human involvement
- **Automated quotes:** For catering requests, system could analyze request and generate quote
- **Lead tracking:** Centralized view of all requests and their status

**Time Impact:**
- "All those small little things and then staying on top of it is the next part"
- Requests come through HubSpot form, email, social media DMs
- Multiple touchpoints create tracking chaos
- No visibility into response times or pending requests

**Derek's Ideal for Catering:**
> "A system where someone can call or email, it can spit back a quote or an idea or have a conversation with them. They can tell you what they want, she can basically get and say oh they want the xyz, she can say it already knows the prices they've already sent it to her. She can approve it, send it."

**Phone System Vision:**
> "I think if we had a system where I can give a phone—because I think people are quicker to call someone than email—but if they can call and say, I've seen the ads, I'm looking to reserve or book or cater—response to be like, oh, I would love to help you. What are you looking for? And they could just handle that request, that little talk of whatever you need, and then send it to us."

---

## Important Flags

### Scope Considerations
- **Derek's #1 priority (social media) ≠ Jenna's #1 priority (partnership coordination)**
- This creates potential conflict in implementation prioritization
- Need follow-up call with BOTH partners to align on priorities
- Different pain points suggest different value perceptions

### Personal Motivation
- **Derek wants TIME BACK, not to work more**
- Quote: "I would want to put more time into the business or the same time into the business"
- Main goal: Personal time for leisure, hobbies, maybe another business
- Not motivated by business growth/revenue - motivated by work-life balance

### Technical Constraints
- **Must switch from Clover to Square** (integration issues)
- Current systems don't talk to each other (POS, accounting, booking)
- Need platform that integrates across functions
- Small town limitations (supplier options, internet, etc.)

### Budget Signals
- Willing to pay for solutions if ROI is clear
- Example: Would pay $1K if social media solution was "worth it"
- Currently profitable ($200K gross, $30K take-home)
- But cash may be tight due to building renovation

### Timeline Considerations
- New building under renovation (Derek managing trades)
- Want systems in place BEFORE venue opening
- More urgent for Jenna (operational bottlenecks) than Derek (quality of life)

### Contractor Market Opportunity
- Derek sees same problems in contractor/trades industry
- Scheduling and phone answering as biggest pain points
- Potential to build for East Coast Commune, then sell to contractors
- Derek willing to refer/introduce
- **Important:** Don't build on speculation - validate with actual contractor conversations

### On Inventory & Systems

> "There's no system to say, oh, we bought a case of this, it's running low, we should order a case of this at this time, so we know in two weeks we'll have to order again.

**Duration:** ~51 minutes
**Recording Quality:** Good
**Client Engagement:** High - honest about struggles, open to solutions
**Relationship:** Friends - more casual conversation style
**Follow-up Required:** Joint call with Derek + Jenna to align priorities

---

## Consultant Notes

**Key Insight: Priority Misalignment**
- Derek prioritizes social media/marketing (2-3 hrs/day personal time drain)
- Jenna prioritizes partnership coordination (business-threatening communication breakdown)
- This misalignment MUST be addressed in joint call
- Risk: If partners aren't aligned, solution won't be adopted by both

**Derek's Motivation: Quality of Life**
- Not motivated by revenue growth or business expansion
- Wants systems to "handle it" so he can reclaim personal time
- May be less willing to invest time in implementation
- Solutions must be quick-setup, low-maintenance

**Blaze AI Lesson:**
- Derek wants AI tools but needs customization
- Authenticity matters more than polish
- Watermarks/attribution are dealbreakers
- Solution must feel like it's from them, not a third party

**Contractor Opportunity - Proceed with Caution:**
- Derek's observation about contractors is speculative
- Don't build on speculation - validate with actual contractor pain
- Could be referral opportunity AFTER proving solution with East Coast Commune
- Potential revenue share model if successful

**Technical Ecosystem Considerations:**
- Planning to switch POS (Clover → Square)
- All solutions should integrate with Square
- Current QuickBooks failure shows integration is critical
- Build ecosystem map before recommending tools

**Project Fit Assessment:**
- ✅ Clear pain points with quantified time waste (Derek: 2-3 hrs/day)
- ✅ Willing to pay for solutions
- ✅ Profitable business with growth trajectory
- ⚠️ Priority misalignment between partners
- ⚠️ Derek wants out of day-to-day (may resist implementation effort)
- ⚠️ Cash constraints from renovation
- ⚠️ Limited time for testing/onboarding
- ✅ Urgent timeline (venue opening)

**Sales Strategy Notes:**
- Lead with social media solution for Derek buy-in
- Show quick wins to prove ROI before bigger investments
- Address Jenna's priority (coordination) in parallel or first phase
- Phase approach: Prove value → Expand scope → Referrals
- Emphasize time savings (Derek's motivation) over revenue (not primary driver)

**Risk Factors:**
- Partners have different priorities (coordination risk)
- Derek wants "set it and forget it" but may need ongoing management
- Renovation consuming attention and budget
- Small team means limited capacity for implementation

**Success Factors:**
- Both partners aware of pain
- Business profitable and growing
- Urgent timeline (venue opening)
- Willing to pay for solutions
- Multiple pain points = multiple entry points
- Friend relationship = trust foundation
