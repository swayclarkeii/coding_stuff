# Meeting Notes - East Coast Commune Discovery Call
**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Type:** Discovery Call
**Client:** Jenna
**Company:** East Coast Commune (Bar, Restaurant & Catering)
**Attendees:** Jenna (Co-owner), Sway Clarke (Consultant)

---

## Executive Summary

Jenna is co-owner of East Coast Commune with her partner Derek, operating a bar/restaurant with catering services in Nova Scotia. They're 2-3 months away from opening a new location after 3 years of preparation. Primary pain points include: manual accounting/receipt management (2 hours/week when maintained, accumulates when neglected), lack of centralized scheduling/communication system between partners causing double-bookings, manual catering quote generation (15-20 minutes per lead, 2-5 leads/week), and price comparison workflow for grocery shopping (significant time but ROI unclear). The most critical issue is the partnership communication breakdown - both wearing multiple hats without a unified system to track events, bills, payroll, and daily operations. This inefficiency will become unsustainable when they scale into the new larger location.

---

## Business Context

### Current Operation
- **Business Type:** Bar/restaurant with pop-up location + catering services
- **Team Size:** 2 owners (Jenna & Derek) + 2 staff members (work only, no management duties)
- **Current Location:** Pop-up venue with limited kitchen (household stove)
- **New Location:** Commercial space opening February-March 2025 (3-year renovation project)
- **Main Challenges:** Partnership coordination, administrative overhead, scaling preparations

### Current Tools & Systems
- **Accounting:** Manual Excel spreadsheet (YouTube-learned), Expensify mentioned as potential solution
- **Calendar:** Physical wall calendar (color-coded), Jenna takes daily photos of it
- **Communication:** Separate email accounts (info@, jenna@, derek@), no dedicated catering email
- **Catering:** Manual email responses, no automated forms or quote generation
- **Shopping:** Physical flyers (delivered Tuesdays), manual price comparison when time allows

### Business Division
- **Derek:** Social media, marketing, advertising, content creation, bar events booking
- **Jenna:** Catering, quotes, accounting, receipts, scheduling, payroll

---

## Key Pain Points Identified

### 1. Accounting & Receipt Management (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Manual, procrastinated, time-consuming receipt tracking

**Current Process:**
- Receipts accumulate in purse "falling out everywhere"
- Manual entry into Excel: date, expense account (food/beverage/alcohol), pre-tax, tax, total
- Separate tracking for food (no tax) vs non-food (taxed) items
- Monthly revenue tracking in same spreadsheet
- Annual handoff to accountant for tax filing only

**Time Investment:**
- **When maintained:** Few minutes daily = ~2 hours/week
- **When neglected:** "A couple hours" to catch up on accumulated receipts
- Procrastination is significant: "I hate it with a passion"

**Impact:**
- Nightmares about disorganized receipts
- Delayed financial visibility
- "If I don't know down to dollars and cents, I'll just run out and buy chicken at Superstore when I could have gotten it at Sobeys for cheaper"
- Lost receipts suspected but not confirmed

**Jenna's Quote:**
> "Opening my purse and seeing receipts falling out everywhere and then knowing I have to deal with them eventually. So I tend to procrastinate on that. Big time."

**Previous Attempt:**
- Tried QuickBooks receipt scanning
- Issue: Couldn't separate taxed vs non-taxed items automatically
- "If I'm doing this anyway, why am I paying for the program?"
- Abandoned in favor of manual Excel method

### 2. Partnership Communication & Coordination (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Problem:** No centralized system for Jenna & Derek to share operational information

**Current State:**
- Physical calendar on wall (color-coded)
- Jenna takes daily photos to reference when away
- Derek has separate information Jenna doesn't see
- Both managing different aspects independently
- "Sometimes I don't know the event that's going on at the bar until I physically look at the calendar"
- Double-bookings occurring (recent example: Christmas party vs band booking)

**What's Missing:**
- Shared event/catering calendar
- Bill tracking visibility
- Payroll information access
- Revenue/expense dashboard
- Who's working when (schedule)

**Time Impact:**
- Tuesday = payroll day: "scramble to get things from three different places"
- Meeting time wasted on "vomiting information" instead of productive discussion
- "Derek has little notes on just pieces of paper everywhere"

**Jenna's Ideal Solution:**
> "If we had a dashboard kind of thing where the schedule was right there, the bills we owe are right there, what we made and sold was there—somewhere where we both can see everything at one time."

**Quote on Communication Style:**
> "Derek and I are very different communicators. I'm very ABC, let's cross this off our list. And he's like..."

**Urgency:**
When asked what happens if this doesn't get sorted in 6-12 months:
> "Is he going to move to Germany with you?" (indicating relationship strain)
> "It just gets frustrating because it's for both of us."

### 3. Catering Lead Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Manual qualification and quote generation process

**Current Flow:**
1. Inquiry comes to info@eastcoastcommune → Derek receives → forwards to Jenna
2. Jenna manually responds asking qualifying questions:
   - Party size (can't handle >50 people with current household stove)
   - Date availability
   - Type of service (venue vs off-site)
   - What they're looking for
3. Jenna sends appropriate menu (venue vs off-site vs appetizers)
4. Customer may request specialty items outside menu
5. Back-and-forth via email thread
6. Jenna writes everything on physical paper (time, person, order, drop-off time, address, etc.)

**Time Investment:**
- ~15-20 minutes per potential client to close deal
- 2-5 catering requests per week
- Total: ~1-2 hours/week on lead management
- **Recent volume:** Last week had 7 catering gigs (Wed, Thu, 2x Fri, Sun, Mon)

**Pain Points:**
- No dedicated catering@ email (causes confusion on who saw what)
- No initial qualification form (wastes time on incompatible requests)
- Email thread diving to find original information
- Manual paper tracking system (though Jenna prefers physical notes)
- Specialty requests require judgment calls

**What Works:**
- Jenna can handle custom requests outside standard menu
- Three menu types: venue service, off-site catering, appetizers/grazing
- Higher pricing justified by customization and quality

**Jenna's Quote on Ideal System:**
> "If I had a sheet that they could either fill out that I send to them and they fill out and then I just adjust... If I could just have one sheet that I always refer back to or can save or can print off or whatever, then I just know."

### 4. Grocery Shopping & Price Comparison (LOWER PRIORITY - ROI UNCLEAR)
**Problem:** Time spent on price comparison may not justify savings

**Current Process:**
- Physical flyers delivered every Tuesday to driveway
- Manually review flyers for deals
- Know general pricing at Walmart, Costco, Superstore, Sobeys
- Costco is cheapest but 1-hour drive (2-hour round trip)
- Buy month's worth at Costco, then supplement weekly at local stores
- When in pinch: go to closest store (30 seconds away) despite higher prices

**Time Investment:**
- Actual time unknown - Jenna doesn't spend much time on it
- "I hate being on my phone, looking at things. I do not online shop unless I have to"
- Generally defaults to Walmart (known cheapest) or closest store when rushed

**Actual Savings:**
- Unknown - never calculated
- Described as "not cheaper by $5, it's cheaper by a dollar"
- $50/month savings "almost not worth the time"

**App Attempts:**
- Tried price comparison apps before
- "I just hate it. I hate it."
- Prefers physical flyers

**Sway's Key Question:**
> "What you're actually saving with all of this price comparison... how much money are you actually saving at the end of the month? Because it sounds like a lot of stress."

**Jenna's Acknowledgment:**
> "Exactly. Because like $50 is almost not worth the time it takes to do all of that, right? ... If we saved all that time and energy, where could you put that energy?"

**Hypothetical Ideal (Jenna's Suggestion):**
> "What would be very helpful is if you had something where each small business could go in and be like, okay, almost every week I buy chicken, I buy cranberry juice, I buy blah, blah, blah. You could put that into the app and then they would show you, oh, Superstore has chicken cheapest this week."

### 5. Pricing Confidence (PERSONAL CHALLENGE)
**Problem:** Self-doubt on pricing strategy

**Current Method:**
- Calculate grocery costs
- Triple the expense for pricing
- Compare to market (friend in Toronto says prices are too low)
- Lost clients due to "pricing too high" locally

**Philosophy:**
- Won't lower standards to get $200 gigs
- "We price it the way we do because it looks better than everywhere else, it tastes better than everywhere else, we use better products"
- Willing to lose price-shopping clients

**Jenna's Quote:**
> "I do and I don't. I do, but then I always sort of second guess myself."

**Sway's Assessment:**
> "It's not like the process of pricing is very difficult, you know how to do it. It's just more like being self-conscious about saying the number out loud."

## Current Workarounds & Systems

### 1. Excel Spreadsheet Accounting System
- Learned from YouTube video
- Tracks: date, expense account, pre-tax, tax, total
- Monthly summaries (e.g., "January, we spent $500 on supplies")
- Separate revenue tracking
- Manual entry for every purchase
- Distinction between food (tax-free) and non-food (taxed) products

### 2. Physical Calendar System
- Wall calendar at bar location
- Color-coded entries (catering vs bar events)
- Both Jenna & Derek write on it
- Jenna takes daily photos for reference
- Problem: Not always updated, Derek doesn't see catering additions timely

### 3. Catering Paper Tracking
- Physical paper for each gig
- Written details: time, person, order, drop-off time, address, info
- Papers "lined out" for the week
- Provides "physical satisfaction from crossing out something on my list"

**Jenna's Quote:**
> "If I get a catering gig, I write down the time, the person, what they are ordering, what time it has to be dropped off, all of their information, where it's going."

### 4. Email Forwarding
- Inquiries go to info@eastcoastcommune (Derek monitors)
- Derek forwards catering requests to Jenna
- Repeat clients email jenna@eastcoastcommune directly
- No visibility into who's handling what

### 5. Flyer Review (Inconsistent)
- Physical flyers Tuesdays
- Reviews when time allows
- Defaults to known cheapest stores when rushed
- No systematic tracking of best prices

---

## Topics Discussed

### 1. Receipt Management Crisis
- Depth of Jenna's hatred for accounting: "I hate it with a passion"
- Economics degree background but "only went to school to play basketball"
- QuickBooks experience and why it failed
- Expensify recommendation from Sway (iOS app, ~$5/month)
- Discussion of AI-powered scanning vs old programs
- Time spent manually categorizing tax vs non-tax items

### 2. Visual Dashboard Need
- Jenna wants to "see exactly where I'm spending my money and where I can save"
- Real-time visibility vs post-hoc manual entry
- Derek's scattered paper notes giving Jenna anxiety
- Need for both partners to access same information simultaneously

### 3. Partnership Work Division
- Derek: comfortable delegating to Jenna
- Derek's response to Sway wanting to talk to Jenna directly: relief
- Both wearing "so many hats" (bar manager, kitchen manager, scheduler, accountant, etc.)
- Renovation adding more hats for Derek
- Impact of having no middle management layer

### 4. Physical vs Digital Preference
- Jenna is "very physical" - needs to write things down, see it, feel it
- Hasn't tried all digital pad options (Sway suggested paper-feel digital pads)
- "It doesn't do it for me" (glass tablets)
- Willing to try new tech but needs transition support ("security blanket")
- "I hate being on my phone, looking at things"

### 5. Scaling Concerns
- 3-year renovation project finally culminating
- Currently paying: house mortgage + old venue rent + new building mortgage
- Need steady income until new venue opens (considering outside jobs)
- Once open, will "stop paying rent at the place we're in now"
- Catering business unexpectedly took off: "didn't foresee being this huge"

**Timeline:**
- Derek says: January opening
- Jenna says: realistically February-March
- Can't pay two rents anymore once moved in
- May start with catering-only while furniture/setup completes

### 6. School & Family Interruptions
- Snow day during call (5-6 inches)
- Z (child) home from school
- 10-minute parent-teacher conference tomorrow (full school closure)
- Primary grade report card ("doing as expected")
- Context of family business balance

### 7. Work-Life Integration
- Both running business while managing family
- Time for outside jobs vs investing time in business growth
- "If we're putting eight hours a day into a different job, that's taking away eight hours from our business"

## Problems to Solve (Priority Order)

### CRITICAL (Business-Threatening)

1. **Unified Partnership Dashboard**
   - Shared calendar (bar events + catering gigs)
   - Bills due tracking
   - Payroll information
   - Revenue/expense visibility
   - Staff schedule
   - Must be easily updatable by both partners
   - Must be accessible remotely
   - Excel-based acceptable if it works

**Why Critical:** Double-bookings occurring now; will become crisis at new larger venue

**Jenna's Final Answer on Magic Wand:**
> "That would be the biggest issue. It's not what I want to say, but I think it is the biggest issue."

### HIGH PRIORITY

2. **Accounting/Receipt Automation**
   - Automatic receipt capture (photo-based)
   - Auto-categorization by tax status
   - Real-time expense dashboard
   - Revenue tracking integration
   - Export to accountant annually
   - Must handle Nova Scotia tax rules (food vs non-food)

**Why High:** 2 hours/week minimum, causes stress/nightmares, delays financial visibility

**Evaluation Needed:**
- Test Expensify with Nova Scotia tax scenarios
- Confirm category customization
- Verify export capabilities for year-end accounting

3. **Catering Lead Qualification System**
   - Dedicated catering@ email address
   - Initial qualification form (party size, date, location, budget, service type)
   - Auto-send appropriate menu based on form responses
   - Special request field for out-of-menu items
   - Centralized tracking sheet (printable for Jenna's preference)
   - Integration with partnership dashboard calendar

**Why High:** 1-2 hours/week, growing business segment, prevents incompatible leads

**Time Savings:** ~15-20 min/lead × 2-5 leads/week = 30-100 min/week

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

4. **Note-Taking System for Derek**
   - Capture Derek's "little notes on just pieces of paper everywhere"
   - Integrate into shared system
   - Reduce information siloing

**Why Medium:** Contributing to communication breakdown but less quantified impact

### LOW PRIORITY (ROI Uncertain)

5. **Price Comparison Optimization**
   - Weekly flyer aggregation
   - Common items price tracking (chicken, cranberry juice, etc.)
   - Store recommendation based on shopping list
   - Gas cost consideration (Costco 2-hour trip)

**Why Low:** Time investment unclear, savings appear minimal ($1-2/item), Jenna hates digital shopping tools

**Decision Point:** Measure actual savings over one month before investing in solution

6. **Pricing Confidence Building**
   - This is personal/psychological, not systematic
   - May resolve with better financial visibility (dashboard showing profitability)
   - Potentially: competitor pricing database, but Jenna already researching

**Why Low:** Not a process issue, more of a confidence issue

## Important Flags

### Scope Considerations
- **No formal project scope yet** - this is discovery
- **Phase 1 should focus on partnership dashboard** - highest stated priority
- **Account for new venue transition** (February-March) - systems must scale
- **Pro bono opportunity** - sister Nicole (A Mother's Touch) is parallel learning case

### Technical Constraints
- **Digital resistance:** Jenna prefers physical/tactile systems
- **Mobile aversion:** "I hate being on my phone"
- **Must accommodate transition:** "security blankets" needed while adopting new systems
- **Nova Scotia-specific:** Tax rules, store availability, flyer culture
- **Two-user minimum:** System must work for both Jenna & Derek simultaneously

### Budget & Business Constraints
- **Cash-flow tight:** Paying 3 mortgages simultaneously until move
- **No staff capacity:** 2 employees don't do admin work
- **Limited implementation time:** Both partners fully occupied
- **Can't stop operations:** Solutions must implement alongside business
- **Seasonal spike:** Catering demand high around call date (holidays)

### Personality Considerations
- **Jenna:** Detail-oriented, physical learner, procrastinates on hated tasks, direct communicator
- **Derek:** More digital-comfortable, delegates easily, scattered note-taking
- **Communication styles differ:** "I'm very ABC, let's cross this off our list. And he's like..."
- **Decision-making:** Both must agree on priorities and solutions

### Opportunities
- **Clean slate:** New venue = opportunity to implement systems from day one
- **Pain awareness:** Both partners recognize current system isn't sustainable
- **Tech openness:** Jenna willing to try solutions despite preferences
- **Growth trajectory:** Catering unexpectedly successful, likely to grow more
- **Timeline urgency:** 2-3 months creates implementation deadline
- **Learning moment:** A Mother's Touch project can inform this one

### Red Flags
- **Relationship strain:** Jenna's joke about Derek moving to Germany indicates stress level
- **Scaling cliff:** Current systems will catastrophically fail at new venue size
- **Financial opacity:** Not knowing expenses in real-time leads to inefficient purchasing
- **Communication breakdown:** "We barely see each other" - async system critical

## Key Quotes

### On Accounting Pain

> "Opening my purse and seeing receipts falling out everywhere and then knowing I have to deal with them eventually. So I tend to procrastinate on that. Big time. I will admit that's my downfall because then I'm like, well, I just have to get this done and I can do it in a pinch." - Jenna

> "I'm pretty good at keeping it all in a jumbled pile, but I'm sure [I've lost receipts]." - Jenna

### On Scaling Urgency

> "It's a little challenging because it's literally just him and I running the business. We have two staff members but they just work and get paid and that's it." - Jenna

> "We're everything. We're the bar manager, the kitchen manager, the scheduler, the accountant, everything. We're doing everything. When we are both doing that separately, it's challenging when we come together." - Jenna

### On Catering Growth

## Consultant Notes

**Client Communication Style:** Direct, honest, self-aware, descriptive, willing to admit challenges
**Business Sophistication:** Organized chaos - has systems but they're breaking down under scale
**Tech Adoption:** Mixed - prefers physical but willing to try digital with proper support
**Problem Articulation:** Excellent - clear pain points, understands workflows, recognizes urgency
**Urgency:** HIGH - new venue opening in 2-3 months, current systems unsustainable
**Decision-Making:** Partnership-based, Jenna focused on operations, needs Derek's buy-in
**Budget Indicators:** Cash-tight due to three mortgages, needs ROI justification

**Sales Strategy Notes:**
- Lead with partnership dashboard (highest emotional priority)
- Phase implementation: Dashboard → Accounting → Catering
- Emphasize "security blankets" approach for physical-to-digital transition
- Demonstrate quick setup (they have NO time)
- Show how it prevents relationship strain (emotional hook)
- Tie to new venue success (urgency hook)
- Keep costs transparent and justifiable
- Consider both Jenna AND Derek in solution design

**Project Fit Assessment:**
- ✅ Clear pain points with quantifiable time waste
- ✅ Willing client, open to solutions
- ✅ Timeline urgency creates commitment
- ✅ Parallel learning with A Mother's Touch project
- ⚠️ Budget constraints (3 mortgages)
- ⚠️ Implementation time limited (new venue prep)
- ⚠️ Must accommodate physical preference in digital solution
- ✅ Relationship stakes make this high-priority for client

**Risk Factors:**
- New venue opening may consume all attention/budget
- Partnership communication challenges may extend to consultant interaction
- Physical preference may limit digital solution adoption
- Budget constraints may delay or limit scope

**Success Factors:**
- Strong pain awareness from both partners
- Clear timeline deadline (venue opening)
- Existing system documentation (Excel, calendar, etc.)
- Willingness to try new approaches
- Multiple pain points = multiple entry points for value
- Existing tech usage (email, Excel) shows baseline comfort
