# Eugene - Discovery Call
## Initial Problem Definition Session

**Date:** December 8, 2024
**Time:** Meeting duration ~59 minutes
**Attendees:** Sway Clarke (Consultant), Eugene (Client)
**Meeting Type:** Discovery / Problem Definition
**Recording:** https://fathom.video/share/zZNr84ivryM8RzAzzxHg5p4yn6XJLrvK

## Executive Summary

**Meeting Purpose:** Define the biggest bottleneck in Eugene's workflow and propose an automation solution.

**Outcome:** Identified manual document verification as consuming ~80% of Eugene's time per client, preventing scaling from 6 to 15 clients/year. Proposed automated document workflow system with performance-based pricing model.

**Next Steps:** Formal proposal presentation scheduled for Dec 15, 11:00 AM.

**Deal Status:** ✅ Closed (proposal accepted on Dec 15)

## The Core Problem

### Primary Bottleneck: Manual Document Verification

**Current Situation:**
- Eugene handles ~6 real estate investment deals per year
- Wants to scale to 15 deals/year
- Spends ~80% of time per client on manual document verification
- Each deal requires verification of ~18 documents

**Current Workflow (Inefficient):**

1. **Collection:** Clients email unlabeled, jumbled documents
2. **Verification:** Each file manually opened, identified, labeled, checked against master checklist
3. **Analysis:** Verified files manually uploaded to ChatGPT agent for analysis and follow-up question generation

**Why This Kills Deals:**
- Incomplete/incorrect documents waste significant time and money
- Example: Missing critical *Bargain Immigrant* clause can kill entire deal
- No upfront filtering = wasted effort on bad deals

**Time Cost:**
- Eugene's hourly rate: €180-200/hour
- Manual verification: ~8-10 hours per deal
- Theoretical cost per deal: €1,440-€2,000

## The Proposed Solution

### Automated Document Workflow System

**Phase 1: Structured Document Intake**
- Clients upload files via structured form (not email)
- Immediate organization and labeling
- No more jumbled, unlabeled attachments

**Phase 2: Automated Processing**
- System downloads, analyzes, and labels documents automatically
- Checks for completeness against full ~18-document list
- Enforces "must-have" list of 4-5 critical documents:
  - *Grundbuch* (land registry)
  - Teaser
  - Calculation
  - Exit strategy
  - [1-2 other critical docs]

**Phase 3: Smart Filtering**
- Auto-rejects deals missing "must-haves"
- Sends automated follow-ups for other missing items
- Only complete/near-complete deals reach Eugene

**Phase 4: AI Analysis Backend**
- Verified documents fed into AI via API (bypassing manual ChatGPT interface)
- Generates analysis and follow-up questions
- Delivers output to Eugene for review

**Human Checkpoint:**
- Eugene reviews final analysis
- Eugene manually sends follow-up email to client (maintains personal touch)

## Business Model Discussion

### Performance-Based Pricing (Proposed & Accepted)

**Sway's Proposal:**
- 5-10% of closed deal commission
- Aligns incentives: payment tied directly to system's value
- Eugene pays only when deals close successfully

**Eugene's Reaction:**
- **Strongly endorsed this model**
- Prefers performance-based over fixed fee
- Rationale: Fair because system saves time AND enables more deals

**Value Calculation:**
- Time saved: 8-10 hours per deal
- Theoretical saving: €1,440-€2,000 per deal
- Real value: Ability to scale from 6 to 15 deals/year (2.5x growth)

## Key Insights & Learnings

### What Makes This a Good Client Match

1. **Clear, Measurable Problem:** 80% time waste on one specific task
2. **Quantifiable Value:** Can calculate exact time/money saved
3. **Scalability Blocker:** Solution directly enables business growth
4. **Performance Pricing Possible:** Clear ROI allows commission-based model
5. **Technical Fit:** Problem is solvable with automation (document processing, AI)

### What Eugene Values

- **Efficiency over perfection:** Wants 80% solution that works, not 100% that takes forever
- **Aligned incentives:** Performance-based pricing shows commitment
- **Personal touch preserved:** Automation handles grunt work, Eugene keeps client relationships
- **Speed to value:** Wants to see impact quickly

## Technical Feasibility Questions

**Sway's Open Questions (to research):**
- How complex is document analysis for German real estate docs?
- Can AI reliably identify and label document types?
- What's the error rate on automated verification?
- How to handle edge cases (unusual document formats, handwritten notes, etc.)?

**Action Item:** Consult with developer on technical feasibility before proposal

## Next Steps (From Meeting)

**Sway:**
- ✅ Send calendar invite for Dec 15, 11:00 AM meeting
- ✅ Draft formal proposal outlining project scope and performance-based model
- ✅ Consult with developer on technical feasibility of document analysis

**Eugene:**
- ✅ Share Dropbox folder with sample client documents + full data room structure
- ✅ Send "mastermind" ChatGPT prompt
- ✅ Send document checklist (full 18-document list + "must-have" subset)
