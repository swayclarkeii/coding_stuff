## Using This Reference

When planning your day or week:

1. Check which day it is
2. Reference the work window
3. Note the energy level (run day or not)
4. Plan tasks that fit the time AND energy available
5. Respect family commitments absolutely

**Remember:** This schedule allows for ~50-55 productive hours per week. That's more than enough to build Oloxa.ai successfully - as long as those hours are focused and intentional.
