## General Insights

### Charging for Development Costs on "Free" Projects

**The Problem:**
- Offering free testimonial projects to build portfolio
- Projects require developer help (can't build solo)
- No budget to hire developers
- Hesitant to ask developers for free work

**The Solution:**
- **Charge clients for development costs, even on testimonial projects**
- Frame as: "You still get the solution for free (my consulting time), but we need to cover the cost of specialized development resources"
- This is NOT breaking your word - the core agreement (free solution) remains intact
- You're simply covering hard costs that weren't in the original scope

**How to Frame It:**
> "As I've been scoping this project, I've realized we need specialized development work to deliver the highest quality solution. The good news is you're still getting the solution and my consulting time for free. The only cost would be covering the developer's time at [X amount]. Does that work for you?"

**When the Equation Changes:**
- It's okay to update agreements when new information emerges
- Key: Be transparent and explain WHY the change is needed
- Most clients will understand if you're honest
- If they don't understand, they probably weren't the right client anyway

### Me vs. Me: The Comparison Trap

**The Problem:**
- Comparing progress to other Accelerator members creates anxiety
- External competition = self-imposed pressure
- Leads to burnout and imposter syndrome
- Takes focus away from personal growth

**The Solution:**
- Shift from "me vs. them" to "me vs. me"
- Ask: **"Am I better than the Sway I was two months ago?"**
- Measure progress against your past self, not others' highlight reels
- Everyone's timeline is different

**Evidence of Growth to Celebrate:**
- Ability to decline bad-fit clients (shows confidence)
- Recognition of red flags in client dynamics
- Improved scoping and pricing conversations
- Building systems and documentation

### Building Confidence Through Delivery

**The Strategy:**
- Focus on successfully delivering current testimonial projects
- Don't take on new free work while existing projects are incomplete
- Use testimonials to build portfolio and social proof
- Transition to charging for ALL new work after portfolio established

**Timeline:**
- Deliver current testimonials: Dec-Jan
- Transition to paid-only work: January 2025
- Use holiday break for strategic planning (SOPs, frameworks, branding)

### Using Accelerator Resources

**How to Get Unstuck:**
- Use "Coaches Insights" search filter on platform
- Search for topics: "pricing", "testimonials", "scoping", etc.
- Review guidance from Darren, Eric, Otto
- Request strategy calls when needed

## Client-Specific: East Coast Commune Debrief

### The Situation

**Context:**
- Derek (old friend) called for help with restaurant business
- Joint meeting with partner (Jenna) became "therapy session"
- Exposed fundamental partnership communication breakdown
- Derek: visionary, expects people to "figure it out"
- Jenna: executor, needs clear details and structure

**Sway's Concern:**
- Feels like project needs partnership counseling, not tech consulting
- Worried about getting stuck in middle of drama
- Uncertain whether to take project or walk away

### Mara's Guidance (Implied from Summary Context)

**Key Decision Criteria:**
- Is Derek someone you're afraid of losing? (Yes - old friend)
- Would you regret not trying to help? (Probably yes)
- Can you set clear boundaries? (Critical)

**If You Proceed:**
- Frame as process consulting, NOT tech solutions
- Derek needs to understand this is about leadership and communication
- Jenna needs to commit to using new systems
- Both need to acknowledge their working style mismatch

**Personal Growth Opportunity:**
- This is exactly the kind of challenge that builds new skills
- Process consulting for small businesses = valuable niche
- Document everything for content and future clients
- BUT: Only if you can maintain boundaries

**The Confidence Test:**
- Your ability to see the red flags = growth
- Your hesitation to dive in blindly = wisdom
- Your consideration of walking away = healthy boundaries
