## Key Takeaways

### Most Important Decision
**D2: Include Ambushed Admin Team in Discovery Call**

**Why it matters:** Prevented building solution based only on decision maker's perspective. Ensures understanding of full workflow including data entry pain points. This pattern of stakeholder inclusion is reusable across all future client engagements.

**Client response:** "I would be interested in not only, you know, speeding up my process, but also theirs [admin team]" - shifted thinking from personal to team efficiency.

### Most Urgent Action
**A6 & A1: Schedule Follow-Up Calls (Target: Jan 13-17, 2026)**

**Critical path:**
1. Sway sends calendar link (A6) → BLOCKS everything
2. Sindbad shares availability (A1) → BLOCKS call scheduling
3. Calls scheduled → BLOCKS proposal phase
4. Without these calls: Project stalls, momentum lost

**Deadline:** Calendar link should go out by Jan 9-10, calls scheduled by Jan 12-15

### Key Pattern Discovered
**Human-in-the-Loop as Trust-Building Architecture**

**Insight:** Client initially feared full automation ("I don't want to lose control") but enthusiastically accepted automation with approval checkpoints ("Exactly. That's true. Yeah, completely.").

**Application:** Don't present automation as all-or-nothing. Offer spectrum from "AI assists" to "AI executes with approval" to "AI handles exceptions" to "AI fully autonomous". Let client choose comfort level.

**Impact:** Dramatically increases automation acceptance rate. Client gets time savings without fear of loss of control.

**Reusable framework:** 5 trust levels documented in knowledge base for future use.

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Consultative approach accepted:** Client responded positively to discovery-first methodology
2. **Trust established quickly:** Client shared confidential partnership information in first call
3. **Pattern recognition:** Identified reusable patterns for future engagements
4. **Comprehensive documentation:** Created structured foundation for organized delivery
5. **Stakeholder strategy:** Successfully convinced client to include team members in discovery

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Sales strategy clarity:** Bold Move TV opportunity less defined, may need more pre-work
2. **Budget discussion:** Didn't explicitly discuss pricing expectations (address in next calls)
3. **Timeline commitment:** Gave ranges instead of specific dates (clarify in follow-up)
4. **Technical feasibility:** Assumed API availability (verify in discovery calls)

### Patterns to Repeat
1. **Let client talk:** Spent 80% of call listening, 20% guiding with questions
2. **Stakeholder inclusion:** Recommend involving people who do the work
3. **Human-in-the-loop:** Always offer control checkpoints in automation
4. **Two-meeting strategy:** Separate calls for different problems/stakeholders
5. **Discovery before design:** Resist urge to propose solutions in first call

### Adjustments for Next Engagement
1. **Budget discussion earlier:** Ask about budget expectations in first call
2. **Technical verification:** Confirm API access before proposing API-based solutions
3. **More specific timelines:** Offer concrete dates instead of "next week"
4. **Success metrics upfront:** Define what "success" looks like in discovery phase

## Recommendation for Sway

### Immediate Priority
**Send calendar link TODAY (Jan 12) or tomorrow (Jan 13) at latest.** This is the critical path item blocking all progress.

### Preparation Focus
**Ambushed discovery call prep is higher priority than Bold Move TV research.** Why:
- Ambushed has clearer ROI (20 hrs/month time savings)
- Ambushed has budget available
- Admin team insights critical for solution design
- Bold Move TV needs strategy work first

### Stakeholder Management
**Build relationship with admin team in discovery call.** They are:
- Critical for understanding real workflow
- Key to adoption success
- May reveal efficiencies beyond payment process
- Potential advocates for automation

**Be consultative with Bold Move TV partner.** Remember:
- Strategy may not be clear yet
- Sales capacity is limited
- Don't oversell automation as strategy replacement
- May need to recommend strategy work before automation

### Pricing Strategy
**Price Ambushed for ROI, Bold Move TV for budget:**
- Ambushed: 20 hrs/month @ €X/hr = €Y/month savings → Propose €Z (30-50% of savings)
- Bold Move TV: Budget constrained → Propose lightweight/phased approach
- Consider package discount if both projects approved together

### Success Criteria for Next Week
By end of Jan 17, 2026, you should have:
- ✅ Both discovery calls completed
- ✅ Complete process maps for Ambushed payment workflow
- ✅ Clear sales strategy for Bold Move TV
