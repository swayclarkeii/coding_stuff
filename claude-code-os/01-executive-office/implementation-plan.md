1. **The One Thing** - Each day has ONE priority that matters most
2. **Tiered Tasks** - Not all tasks are equal; prioritize ruthlessly
3. **Zero Friction** - Planning should be fast and easy
4. **Entropy Principle** - 99% can be imperfect; focus on the 1%
5. **Family First** - Protect personal time; sustainable pace wins
