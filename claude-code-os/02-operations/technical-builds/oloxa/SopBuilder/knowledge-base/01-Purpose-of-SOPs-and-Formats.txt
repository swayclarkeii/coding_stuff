[MUSIC] In this video, we look at the purpose
of standard operating procedures and the different formats they come in. By the end of this video, you'll be
able to describe the purpose of standard operating procedures and discuss
the different formats that SOPs come in, and which formats might be most
applicable and which circumstances. One of the reasons that standard operating
procedures get a bad rep is because people think of them as long,
densely worded written text documents, hindering rather than helping. Good work. Good sops are not like that, and
I think people sometimes get confused between standard operating procedures and
specifications. Specifications need to be detailed because
they're defining the exact makeup and tolerances of an item. Specifications form part of the contract
between a producer and the customer and they are often required by regulators and
external inspectors. This course is not about specifications. If your business is mistaking
procedures for specifications and has long text based operating procedures,
then it's doing sops wrong. Let me tell you why the purpose of SOPs. As I said in the previous video,
the watchwords for SOPs are efficiency, quality, and safety. The purpose of SOPs is to
ensure best practice in the operation of a process or activity. Because the phrase standard
operating procedure is very dry, SOPs are called the one best
way in many organizations. And that's a term I'll come
back to later in this course. The term one best way is often
used as a substitute for standard operating procedure
because it's more user-friendly and because it accurately describes
the purpose of the SOP. It is the current one best
way to carry out an activity. It is the current one best way of
delivering consistent quality that meets customer requirements. It's the one best way to ensure
the safety of the work area. It's the current best method of operating
a process, the method which experts and those operating the process can
challenge to create a new best way. In short, an SOP is the current best way
of carrying out the process or activity. Notice my use of the word current there. Operating procedures are useless if
they're not reviewed regularly and kept up to date. The SOP is a baseline against which
proposed improvements can be tested and improvements implemented. I've seen plenty of examples of
out of date procedures in my time, you may have too. Technology has moved on or
the market has changed and the procedure has not been updated for
the new way of working. An SOP that is not regularly reviewed and
revised is worse than useless. Standard operating procedures
are tools for ready and frequent reference by the people
working in the process. Densely written text documents
are not well suited to that use, and SOPs tend to be much
more visually structured. Types of SOP. Standard operating procedures generally
follow one of the following five formats. Number one, photographs and diagrams. Clear pictures of how the process should
look are often the best way to present a simple process. Think of a recipe book, photographs or accurate diagrams of the key parts of
a process with a short description might be all that's needed to operate
that process safely efficiently. Number two, flowcharts. Flowcharts are a very common way of
presenting the one best way for a process. Flowcharts are easy to understand and provide a nice visual step
by step map of the process. Flowcharts would generally be used for
more complicated activities or processes, although the flowchart will often be
accompanied by photographs of the key elements in the process. Number three, checklists. Checklists are a handy reminder of
the steps needed to operate a process or activity safely and efficiently. They are most useful for people who
are already familiar with the process but who need to verify that certain
steps have been carried out, perhaps for safety reasons. Often they will be archived after the
procedure has been completed to show that each requirement was ticked off as
evidence for quality of safety audits. Checklists are usually accompanied by more
detailed procedures to help staff new to the work area. Number four, videos and
electronic instructions. Modern computer controlled equipment
often has a visual display of their operating procedure built-in. These may be animated graphics or
video demonstrations. Software tools are always supported
by video tutorials and help guides. Video operating procedures demonstrating
the steps needed are very useful, provided the people working the processor
activity have ready access to equipment to play the videos
when they feel unsure. Number five, text documents. Earlier in this lesson, I said that text based operating
procedures were a sign of poor sops. That was a generalization
that has some exceptions. Some highly complex processes do need
thorough documentation to ensure they're carried out effectively. Medical procedures, strictly defined
chemical or pharmaceutical processes, or specific legal steps might
require such written Sops. However, it should be noted that the more
complex a process is to execute, the more likely it is
that mistakes will occur. The organisation should work to simplify
such activities as much as possible, perhaps by breaking them down
into constituent parts so that simpler sops can be developed
that minimise the risk of error. In conclusion, the purpose of standard
operating procedures is to identify the best way of delivering a particular
activity or process at the present time. That means they have to be practical and
usable in the workplace. SOPs are not documents for
the office filing cabinet, they are live tools of the process. They are tools as important to the process
as any others used by the team working there. From software tools to wrenches or
computer controlled machines to ensure their usability, sops are usually
visual presentations of the steps and requirements for
operating a process or activity. We'll show some examples of sops
in the next video in this lesson. Now I have a question for.
