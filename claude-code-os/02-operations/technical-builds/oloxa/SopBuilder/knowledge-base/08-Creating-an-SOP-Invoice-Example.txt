In this video we create
a standard operating procedure. By the end of this video,
you will be able create a draft SOP for review with your colleagues. Understand the work
required to prepare an SOP. Let's make an operating procedure, consider a business's
invoice payment process. As I said in an earlier video,
this process needs a standard operating procedure because it contains
a high risk of invoice fraud. In fact, invoice fraud is the biggest
singular area of business fraud. So we need a procedure that
builds in rigorous checks. In essence, the invoice payment
process is very simple and comprises only three check invoice
approve invoice pay invoice. But this process is the main means of
cash leaving a business's bank account, which makes it very high risk. And it's the checks to ensure accuracy and
to prevent fraud that had complexity and
also justify the need for an SOP. As we saw earlier, every standard operating procedure
will have at least five elements. One, purpose two, preparation,
three, process flow, four, checklist, five document control. Let's get started, the first
section of our SOP is its purpose. Here is my take on that supplier
invoice payment standard operating procedure section one purpose
the purpose of this operating procedure is to ensure that genuine supplier
invoices are paid correctly and efficiently within the agreed timescale. The secondary purpose of
the procedure is to detect and eliminate fraudulent attack,
to extract money from the company, and to remove as far as possible, the risks
of invoice fraud against the company. The second section of the SOP is
preparation, being the things we have to put in place before starting
the activity covered by the procedure. This will cover safety equipment and
protective clothing and other essential prerequisites. In the case of an invoice
payment procedure, there is no safety equipment required,
but there are some prerequisites. Section 2, preparation. All staff undertaking
the invoice payment process must be qualified to at
least bookkeeping level 4. All staff undertaking the invoice
payment process must have completed the company's fraud awareness training
within the previous 12 months and must recertify the training
every 12 months. All staff undertaking the invoice payment
process must be trained in this standard operating procedure with their competence
verified by the head of accounts payable. The invoice payment process must be
undertaken through a secure connection to the company's accounting system. The third section of the SOP is
the flowchart for the activity itself. Here is my version for
this fictitious company. Section 3, process flow charts. Receive invoice, emails with invoices attached should be
stored in the Invoices Received inbox. Ensure firewall is active,
open attachment, save in Invoices Received folder. Paper invoices should be scanned
into the Invoices Received folder. Check supplier and payment details. Ensure supplier name and address fully
match a supplier on the supplier database. Ensure bank and payment details match
those on the supplier database. If there is any discrepancy,
inform a team leader or finance manager. Reconcile invoice, match the invoice to its relevant purchase
order and/or goods received note. Check quantities and prices and
ensure totals are correct. Approve for payment. Once all checks are complete,
approve invoice for payment apply the payment terms
on the supplier database. No payment should ever be
made in less than 72 hours. If there is pressure for rush payment,
consult a team leader or finance manager. If at any time you feel things are not
quite right or you suspect fraud, halt any payment and consult your
team leader or finance manager. If necessary, consult our bank fraud team
using the hot light number the fourth section of the SOP is a checklist usually
archived for audit purposes to ensure that key parts of the process or
activity have been completed correctly. For the invoice payment process, there
are several steps that should be recorded. Section four checklist action
person completing date and time completed supplier name and
address match supplier bank details and payment details match quantities and
prices match totals to be paid, checked and matched payment
approved payment date in accordance with contract terms and
no less than 72 hours in future. The final section of our
recipe is document control. When the procedure was approved,
the version number and file reference and the date by which the procedure
should be reviewed. Section 5, Document Control. Document version 2.1 file path xxx/xxxx. Approved by T Rex,
date of approval xx/xx/2x. Due for review by yy/yy/2y. In conclusion, the creation of
standard operating procedures, the key processes and activities
in your business is not onerous. SOPs are working documents and
should be easy to understand and apply in the workplace. At the same time, however, they must
ensure that the work is carried out in a way that meets the standards required. That is the whole point of SOPs. This is not an easy balance to achieve,
and it's likely that your SOPs will go through several iterations
before being implemented. They should also be reviewed regularly
in implementation to ensure that they remain relevant and are meeting the standards that made
the SOP necessary in the first place. Now I have a question for you.
