In this video we discuss the characteristics of an
effective standard operating procedure and the elements we should include. By the end of this video, you'll be
able explain the characteristics of an effective standard operating procedure. Review a business process to
identify if an SOP is required, and outline the main elements
that an SOP should contain. The characteristics of an effective SOP
the purpose of sops, as we've seen, is to ensure best practice in
the operation of a process or activity. Every SOP created, therefore must one identify why
an sops are needed for the activity. We do not need SOPs for every activity
in the business, just those where there are quality, safety and efficiency
requirements that make them necessary. Two, show the most efficient
way to complete the activity or process to the required level of quality. If there's an easier way
of carrying out the task, then the SOP must explain
why this is not permitted. If that is not done properly, people
will inevitably take the easier route. Three, explain the safety precautions
that need to be taken and why they're necessary. Four describe the quality
requirements that must be methadone, including equipment,
settings and tolerances. Five describe the equipment
necessary to carry out the task and the location of that equipment. Six provide an appropriate course
of action should anything in the process not allow it
to operate efficiently. This will include calling a supervisor or
support team. I mentioned that we do not need
standard operating procedures for every task in an organisation. Trying to do that would be overkill. Creating and maintaining sops
is an administrative burden and has to be kept manageable and affordable
by concentrating on the essential tasks. For example, on most projects I've worked
on, there's been a simple procedure for the correct file naming convention because
this allows efficient searching for documents. But there's been no need for a procedure
on how to save your document or how to print it because these
tasks are not critical to quality. That brings us to the following when do
I need a standard operating procedure? The simple answer to the question
when do I need an SOP? Is when you have a routine task
that requires a consistent, efficient or safe way of performing it. Thus, we need a standard operating
procedure when at least one of the following criteria are met. A process, step or activity needs to
achieve consistent results every time. The activity or process is critical
to the quality of the output, the activity or
process is costly to operate and it's necessary to specify
the most efficient method. There is a relatively high
risk of serious consequences, including risk to health,
financial risk or reputational risk. A safe method of working,
therefore, needs to be specified. Routine tasks that are not critical to
quality, not expensive to undertake, and do not have a significant
risk do not need sops. However, even then, a very simple induction sheet
can be helpful to new staff. Elements in an SOP the elements that
make up a standard operating procedure vary depending on the nature
of the task being covered. In the examples in the previous lesson,
I showed some very simple sops for routine tasks in a hospital where
the main purpose was infection control. These SOPs had only five one,
purpose two, preparation, showing the equipment and
training needed, including safety requirements three, process flowchart or
step by step guide. Four, checklist to ensure
correct completion. Five, document control issue number,
file name and date for auditing and revision purposes. Generally, I try to stick to these
five sections, but more complex or technical procedures may require
some additional sections. Scope and responsibilities. Terminology and definitions,
detailed safety briefing, appendices of other relevant information,
including supporting specifications. Equipment manuals, supplier details,
inspection procedures, and so on. Approval signatures. There is a danger in making the standard
operating procedure in use in the workplace too complex and bulky. And my personal preference is to
keep the SOP itself concise and usable with reference documentation
easily accessible in a side area. Of course, having the SOP and reference documentation online avoids
the need for physical documentation, provided that it can be easily
accessed for use in the workplace. In conclusion, we see that effective standard operating
procedures can be challenging to create. On the one hand, they must be
comprehensive enough to ensure safe, consistent, and efficient working,
but on the other hand, they have to be as simple and
accessible as possible. To be both exacting and easily understandable at the same time
is no mean feat, and you can see why youre likely to work through several
iterations before getting it right. In this video, weve looked at the six
characteristics of an effective SOP, the situations in which we need an SOP,
and the five core elements in an SOP. Although complex procedures
may have more elements. In the next video, well discuss meeting
the challenge of creating an SOP. Now I have a question for you. [MUSIC]
