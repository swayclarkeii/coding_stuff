[MUSIC] In this video,
we cover the topic of mistake proofing, called Poka Yoke in
the lean management system. By the end of this video, you'll be able to explain what mistake
proofing entails and why it's important. Give examples of mistake proofing in
organizations.Demonstrate how mistake proofing is an important part of
creating standard operating procedures. Poka Yoke, or mistake proofing,
refers to a team activity that identifies the potential for errors in an activity or
process and seeks to redesign the process in such a way that it's
impossible to make the errors identify it. Essentially, Poka Yoke is about
making a task or activity so straightforward that it's virtually
impossible to get it wrong. There are many examples you
will encounter in daily life. In the hospital, you are likely
to see colour coded stripes or similar markings on the wall or floor. Each colour will take you
to a specific department. In manufacturing, equipment will not operate unless
the safety guard is in place. Often, one function of the equipment
cannot be engaged unless the required previous function has
first been completed. With shape coding, two parts will
only fit together in the correct way. On railway systems, automatic shutoffs
ensure that a train cannot proceed until the signal shows green and sensors show
the next section of line is clear. Software systems will only allow the user
to continue to the next screen once the required information
has been correctly entered. Automatic checks will
verify address details, Social Security details,
postcodes and so on. My car will beep at me incessantly and annoyingly until everyone inside
has their seatbelt fitted. I'm sure you can think of many
more examples of mistake proofing. Mistake proofing and
standard operating procedures. Mistake proofing should
be a fundamental part of developing standard operating procedures,
whether the organization you're working in is applying
a lean management approach or not. SOPs are necessary for processes or activities where there are safety,
quality or cost critical steps, and incorporating mistake proofing
into the development of SOPs for such areas will enhance safety and
quality and reduce cost overruns. We covered the eight steps to creating
an SOP in lesson two of this course. 1, identify the activities and process
steps that need a standardised procedure. 2, create an advisory team. 3, agree the purpose and scope of the SOP. 4, consider the needs
of the target audience. 5, assess the risks in the work area. 6, draft the SOP. 7, finalize and document the SOP. 8, review the SOP regularly. Mistake proofing naturally fits
into step five of this method. Assess the risks in the work area. The following guidelines will help
access records and people's experience of mistakes, faults and failures that
have happened in the process or activity. Examine the points in the process
where those errors arise and identify their causes. With the work team, brainstorm other
potential problem points in the process or activity where errors and
faults could occur. What would the triggers for
those errors be. Develop possible solutions to
the root causes of the problems identified with the work team. Test the potential solutions and
select the most effective. Design and implement the mistake
proofing solutions needed. Test the redesigned process to
ensure it remains efficient and safe and will operate consistently. Build the redesigned
process steps into the SOP. Train employees in the new SOP. Together, mistake proofing and
SOPs change culture. In how to change a culture, published
in the MIT Sloan Management Review, Winter 2010, the author, John Shuck, lays out four criteria to
create an improvement culture. Number one, make it difficult to
make a mistake in the first place. Number two, make it easy to identify
a problem or know when a mistake is made. Number three, make it easy in the normal
course of work to notify a supervisor or manager of the mistake or problem. And number four, be clear and
consistent on what will happen next, what the supervisor or manager will do. These four criteria for culture change
are all facilitated by standard operating procedures
using mistake proofing. We make it difficult to make mistakes
by following the mistake proofing guidelines in this video
when creating SOPs. We make it easy to identify
a problem by working to an SOP. If the work falls out of
alignment with the SOP, then we know we have a problem or mistake. We make it easy to notify a supervisor or
manager by having leader standard work that includes the leader
spending time in the process, speaking to the people working there, and facilitating a daily meeting where
problems and issues are discussed. We can be clear about what will happen
next by ensuring the leader standard work includes supporting the team in
problem solving activity to identify why the problem arose and
identifying ways of resolving it. The leader standard work should
also include regular review of effectiveness of the standard work or
SOPs, in place in the work area. I once helped one of the fraud teams in a
large bank review their detection process. There were problems with identity checking
with the old process sometimes matching the wrong individual to an application
that was being investigated. At the same time, the old process was failing to pick up
fraudsters using multiple identities. I facilitated workshops using problem
solving tools to help the team think through the issues to
identify potential solutions. We mapped the process they went through
and identified the weak points, significantly strengthening
the identity checking elements by introducing more secure
identity checking databases and by building in cross checks
to highlight inconsistencies. Once introduced,
the new procedure spotted more fraudulent applications than before and
also reduced the number of false matches. The savings were significant. In conclusion, mistake proofing, also called poker yoke in lean management,
is an approach that seeks to remove the possibility of making
errors from a process or activity. Where there is a risk of safety failures,
quality problems, or cost overruns, then including mistake proofing activity
into the development of SOPs for the work will greatly enhance the benefits
provided by implementing the procedures. Now, I have a question for you. [MUSIC]
