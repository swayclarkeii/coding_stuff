# SOP Expert Knowledge Base

## What is an SOP?
A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), also called "One Best Way," is the current best method of carrying out a process or activity. SOPs ensure efficiency, quality, and safety through consistent, documented practices.

## When an SOP is Needed
Create SOPs when:
1. Process needs consistent results every time
2. Activity is critical to output quality
3. Process is costly to operate (efficiency matters)
4. High risk of serious consequences (safety, financial, reputational)

Do NOT create SOPs for:
- Simple, routine, well-known tasks
- Tasks not critical to quality/safety/cost
- General activities covered by standard training

## 5 Core Elements of Every SOP

### 1. Purpose
- Why this SOP is needed (quality/safety/efficiency/consistency)
- What outcome it ensures
- One clear sentence describing the goal

### 2. Preparation
- Equipment and tools needed
- Training requirements
- Safety equipment and precautions
- Prerequisites before starting

### 3. Process Flow (Steps)
- Sequential, numbered steps
- Use flowcharts for complex processes
- Include decision points (if X, then Y)
- Specify who does what and when
- Include time estimates where relevant

### 4. Checklist
- Key verification points
- Can be used for sign-off/audit trail
- Confirms critical steps completed

### 5. Document Control
- Version number and date
- Author/approver
- Review date
- File reference

## 5 SOP Format Options

1. **Photographs/Diagrams** - Best for simple visual processes
2. **Flowcharts** - Best for complex processes with decision points
3. **Checklists** - Best for experienced users verifying completion
4. **Videos/Electronic** - Best for equipment with displays
5. **Text Documents** - Only for highly complex/regulated processes

## 6 Characteristics of Effective SOPs

1. **Easy to understand** - Simple, clear language
2. **Visual** - Photos, flowcharts, diagrams
3. **Accessible** - Displayed in workplace, not filed away
4. **Up to date** - Reviewed annually minimum
5. **Referenced** - Links to safety equipment, contacts, related docs
6. **Used in training** - Foundation for onboarding

## Common SOP Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not defining steps clearly ("write for dummies")
2. No visual workflow illustrations
3. Outsourcing to people who don't do the work
4. Fragmented data across departments
5. Paper-only storage (not digitized)
6. Not capturing experienced employee knowledge
7. Multiple conflicting versions

## How to Write SOP Steps

**DO:**
- Use action verbs (Receive, Check, Approve, Send)
- Be specific with measurements ("Heat to 150°F" not "Heat water")
- Include all steps - no magical jumps
- Use "May" (permission), "Must" (required), "Should" (conditional)
- Write in active voice
- Make scannable with bullets and numbered lists

**DON'T:**
- Use jargon or ambiguous terms
- Assume knowledge
- Write dense paragraphs
- Skip "obvious" steps

## SOP Structure Template

```
TITLE: [Process Name] Standard Operating Procedure

PURPOSE:
This SOP ensures [outcome] by defining the [one best way] to [perform activity].

SCOPE:
Applies to: [who/what department]
Frequency: [how often performed]

PREPARATION:
- Equipment: [list]
- Training: [requirements]
- Safety: [precautions/PPE]

PROCEDURE:
Step 1: [Action verb] + [specific instruction]
Step 2: [Action verb] + [specific instruction]
   2.1: [Sub-step if needed]
   2.2: [Sub-step if needed]
Step 3: [Action verb] + [specific instruction]
[Continue as needed]

IF [condition], THEN [action]
IF [problem], THEN [escalation path]

CHECKLIST:
[ ] Step 1 completed
[ ] Step 2 verified
[ ] Quality check passed
[ ] Documentation complete

CONTACTS:
- Issues: [contact]
- Emergencies: [contact]

DOCUMENT CONTROL:
Version: X.X | Date: YYYY-MM-DD | Review by: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Scoring an SOP (0-100 Scale)

**Completeness (40 points)**
- Has clear purpose (10 pts)
- Has preparation section (10 pts)
- Has step-by-step process (10 pts)
- Has checklist/verification (10 pts)

**Clarity (30 points)**
- Steps use action verbs (10 pts)
- Instructions are specific/measurable (10 pts)
- No ambiguous language (10 pts)

**Usability (30 points)**
- Logical flow/sequence (10 pts)
- Includes decision points/escalation (10 pts)
- Appropriate detail level (10 pts)

**Deductions**
- Missing critical safety info (-10)
- Gaps in process flow (-5 per gap)
- Vague instructions (-5 per instance)

**Score Interpretation:**
- 85-100: Excellent - Ready for implementation
- 70-84: Good - Minor improvements needed
- 50-69: Fair - Significant gaps to address
- Below 50: Needs substantial rework

## Key Principles

1. **SOPs are living documents** - Review and update regularly
2. **Involve the people who do the work** - They know the nuances
3. **Keep it visual** - Flowcharts and photos > walls of text
4. **Make it accessible** - In the workplace, not a filing cabinet
5. **Test before finalizing** - Have someone follow it literally
6. **Simpler is better** - Break complex processes into smaller SOPs
