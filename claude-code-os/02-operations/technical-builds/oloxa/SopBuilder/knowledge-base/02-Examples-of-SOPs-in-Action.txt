[MUSIC] In this video I give some examples of
standard operating procedures in action. By the end of this video, you will be able
to describe different SOP formats and the circumstances in which
they might work best. A few years ago, I did a project
creating SOPs for a mid-sized hospital. A safety inspection had detected
potential gaps in patient care in the operating theatres. The surgery itself was well managed,
but infection control and patient management were considered weak. I was part of a small team
creating simple SOPs on laminated sheets to help staff ensure
consistency in their regular tasks. The procedures we created were for
straightforward tasks, but in a hospital it's vital
that even the most straightforward tasks are carried
out consistently and thoroughly. Here is the SOP I created for
cleaning of the patient reception area before the patient was taken
into an operating theatre. This procedure is for
the weekly deep clean and uses a flowchart to illustrate
the steps required. It's readily accessible and
easy to understand. There's a similar flowchart for
the daily clean, and the pack is accompanied by photographs of
the items mentioned in the procedure and a checklist for ready reckoning. In a healthcare situation,
every task has to be defined and specified to ensure patient safety. This even applies to something as simple
as taking a patient's temperature. Here is the SOP I created for the hospital's post operative
temperature checks. This SOP is accompanied by a simple visual
diagram of the equipment required for the test. It may seem excessive, but in a busy hospital where sick
patients can easily become infected, such procedures are essential to
ensure everything is done correctly. Technological changes have made it
much easier to create engaging and accessible operating procedures. For example, here we have a screenshot of part of
an SOP presented on a handheld device. This allows the operator to electronically
record that they've completed each step. And here's the front screen that
appears when a machine is switched on. Note the emphasis on safety before
we get to the procedure flow itself. A small business with several branch
outlets wanted to create a simple checklist procedure for
customer inquiries and quotes. The online training manual for a simple
manufacturing process offers a simple flowchart overview of the whole
manufacturing process. Each step has a more detailed
instruction relating to the critical to quality elements in that step. As we see, the flowchart approach to
standard operating procedures is very common because it's a simple presentation
which lays out the steps very clearly. The flowchart will usually be accompanied
by instructions on safety precautions and protective equipment. It's also very common for
SOPs to use photographs to show the steps. The example shown here is a photographic
flowchart for a textile process. The SOP for fitting an airbag to a car
needs to be displayed in the workplace and easily understandable. Photographs of the key steps are a good
way of illustrating what needs to be done. With these examples in mind, let's consider the common characteristics
of standard operating procedures. Number one, they are easy to understand. The aim of an SOP is to ensure that
the process or activity runs smoothly and safely, and that means it needs to
be easily understood and applied. Number two, they're usually visual. As we see in the examples, most SOPs are
visual, photographs or flowcharts or both. That helps the ease of understanding,
and in some situations we don't want differing levels of literacy to be
a barrier to safe and efficient working. Number three, they're easy to access. The SOP should be displayed
prominently in the workplace so that they can be referred
to without constraint. They are not documents for
the filing cabinet. Operating instructions for
equipment will be located on or next to the equipment itself and often
forms part of the equipment control panel. Number four,
they're relevant and up to date. SOPs that are out of date and
no use and potentially dangerous, operating procedures need to be
reviewed regularly, annually or more frequently in rapidly
changing work areas. We'll come on to monitoring and
reviewing SOPs in the next lesson. Number five,
they refer to other guidance as required. An SOP will always highlight
the safety equipment and precautions required to
carry out a procedure. They may also refer to
other documentation which, although not needed to operate the
process, may be needed from time to time. For example, the SOP may refer to periodic
cleaning or maintenance procedures. There may be a link to information about
any chemicals used in the process, and there will often be reference
to emergency procedures. There will usually be information about
where safety equipment is stored and contact details if there's a problem
in the process, and so on. Number six, they're used in training. The standard operating procedure
represents the current one best way of carrying out a task or
operating a process. That means it's a vital part
of training new staff and is used in refresher training. Once the people using the SOP start to
point out potential problems with it, then it's time to revise the procedure. In conclusion, standard operating
procedures really are the foundation of good practice in any
business activity or process, particularly for process steps where
safety, quality, and cost are vital. In this video, we have seen some
examples of effective procedures. Having covered the definition and
purpose of SOPs in the previous videos, in the next lesson we
look at how to create and maintain standard operating procedures. Now, I have a question for you. [MUSIC]
