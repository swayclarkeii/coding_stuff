In this video, we
talk about monitoring and maintaining the
SOPs that you create. By the end of the video, you'll be able to demonstrate
the importance of regularly reviewing standard
operating procedures. Explain the five ways in which the relevance of SOPs
can be reviewed. I'm sure you've been in a
work area where there was a manual of procedures
locked in a filing cabinet. You may have looked
at them once. Nobody else did, and you
noticed that the work being carried out didn't match
what was in the procedure. I've been in that situation and I asked somebody about them. "Oh, they're old.
We don't do it like that now," was the answer I got. You know as well as I do
that there is nothing more useless than
an out-of-date SOP, and yet it's easy for a working procedure
to become obsolete. A software update takes place, and suddenly the menu
layouts are different. Screens have
changed, and there's a slightly different
method of processing. Or a piece of equipment
gets replaced with something more modern
and more efficient, and the work steps change, or a new manager or supervisor takes over and changes
things around. These things happen
all the time. One day, you come into work
and things have changed, but nobody thinks
to update the SOP. After all, that
requires time and effort, and we're all busy. Things slip, and it may not
seem important at the time, but problems have a
tendency to multiply. I'm sure you remember the
Alaska Airlines incident in January 2024, where a sealed door exit
was suddenly blown out of a Boeing 737 at 14,000 feet. The boy sitting in that
row had his shirt sucked off his body and is
lucky to be alive. Inspections of the
737 fleet found loose bolts and
several other aircraft across different airlines. The Federal Aviation
Administration announced an audit of
production processes, noting that Boeing
had already issued three safety
warnings relating to production defects for
that aircraft model prior to the Alaska
Airlines incident. The Department of Justice have opened a criminal
investigation. The root cause of the problem
has not yet been announced, but poor operating procedures
or inadequate checks that the SOPs were being used is high on the
list of possibilities. Lawsuits have already
hit Alaska Airlines. This is going to cost
Boeing a lot of money. Not to mention the
reputational damage. Standard operating procedures
are typically applied in critical processes or activities where quality safety and
deficiency are paramount. That means that out-of-date SOPs represent a very significant
risk for the business. The risk of a safety incident, that is going to be expensive, the risk of poor quality or defective product getting to
customers, again, expensive. The risk of mistakes
leading to costly rework, the risks of reputational damage affecting future business, the risks of legal action, the risks of financial losses. Monitoring and maintaining SOPs. Standard operating
procedures reduce the risk, but they need to
be monitored and maintained to ensure
they remain valid. How do we do that? There are five ways an organization can monitor the effectiveness of their SOPs and maintain
their relevance. One, organizational
performance measures. Your organization will
have measures of quality, efficiency, and cost in place. If these start to move
away from requirement, that suggests process problems, and one of the causes
of which could be work practices no longer
matching the SOPs. Two, quality and safety audits. Regular audits for quality
and safety purposes should identify procedures
are no longer effective. Three, communication
and feedback. High performing
companies encourage regular communication
with staff, including team meetings. These should review the
effectiveness of working methods and encourage feedback on
the effectiveness of SOPs. Four, staff training. When new staff are introduced to a work area or moved
between areas, they should be trained
in the applicable SOPs. These training sessions
will detect if the procedures in place are
adequate or need revision. Five, regular SOP review. Every SOP should be
reviewed at least annually with the
people in the work area to check if they're still
relevant and to assess if improved working
practices can be developed. Work areas that
experienced rapid change will need to have their SOPs
reviewed more frequently. In conclusion, good standard
operating procedures detail the current best
way of working in an area. They minimize the
risk of quality, safety, or cost
problems arising, but they must be monitored and maintained to ensure they
remain valid and effective. Most businesses already have the structures in
place to do this, including regular meetings, audits, and performance metrics. That means that keeping
your SOPs up to date should not be
an onerous task. Now, I have a question for you.
