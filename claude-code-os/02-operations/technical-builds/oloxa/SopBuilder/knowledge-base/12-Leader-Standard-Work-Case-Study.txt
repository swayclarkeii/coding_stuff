[MUSIC] In this video, we complete our
practice in standard operating procedures with a case study in leader
standard work that is, SOPs for managers, supervisors, and team leaders. By the end of this video, you'll be able
to discuss the advantages of implementing leader standard work draft
a leader standard work checklist. As I discussed in an earlier video,
the benefits achieved by implementing standard operating procedures in
the workplace to ensure consistency, safety, quality, and cost control may
be lost by inconsistent management. Leader standard work remedies this
potential weakness by ensuring that team leaders, supervisors, and
managers carry out regular tasks that support the efficient operation
of SOPs in the workplace. Not every part of a manager's or
supervisor's job is covered by leaders standard work, but just the parts that are
critical to maintaining the consistency and efficiency of the standard
operating procedures in operation. This means that leader standard work is
not structured in the same way as SOPs. Instead, leader standard work is more of
a checklist of tasks than a procedure. It's a set of daily and
weekly key checkpoints for managers and team leaders to ensure
stability of operations. Let's consider an example,
I worked in a financial service company implementing SOPs,
which it called one best way guides. These one best way guides covered
the quality critical elements of the business's processes,
including fraud prevention, calculating the benefits due to policyholders,
and managing payouts to policyholders. These workplace one best way guides
were supported by leader standard work, team leaders and managers. The leader standard work covered broadly
the same topics for line managers. On screen is an example for one of the team leaders showing daily and
weekly tasks. As we see, the mandated leader standard
work is mainly about building a good relationship with the staff working
in the process so that issues and problems can be identified and discussed
and plans put in place to resolve them. Key activities in the leader
standard work include team huddles to review performance,
and assess problems encountered, and process walks to interact
with staff in the workplace. Twice a week, a problem solving
team comprising members of the work team meet to develop solutions
to the problems identified. And once a week there is
a management team review and a review of key performance indicators. The leader standard work for team leaders
in the fraud prevention team included more time to assess
queried applications and transactions with
the staff reviewing them. In this company, even senior managers
were subject to leader standard work with a weekly walk through the open
plan workspace to meet staff and a once fortnight attendance at
a team huddle to show leadership, commitment, and engagement. Senior managers were also involved
in periodic review of the one best way guides. In conclusion, the purpose of leader
standard work is to put regular routines in place for managers and team leaders
to ensure that the standards of quality, safety, and cost established by
the standard operating procedures in the workplace are adhered to, and
to show leadership by example. Leader standard work creates
a channel of communication and interaction between the team leader or
manager and his or her team. And it only applies to those activities
which are essential to ensure that the standard operating procedures
are working effectively. As such, it covers approximately 25%
of a manager's or supervisor's role. It does not stifle initiative or
innovation on the part of the manager, but rather it puts in place a structure
to maintain a close connection with the workplace and to use the information gleaned from that
to develop new plans and initiatives. Leader standard work facilitates
performance improvement by linking the workplace SOPs with management
planning and review systems. Let me finish with a quote from
Bill Bradley, member of the 1964 gold medal winning US Olympic basketball
team and a US senator from 1979 to 1997. He said, leadership is unlocking
people's potential to become better. Leader standard work helps this happen
by building channels of communication. Now I have a question for you. [MUSIC]
