[MUSIC] In this video, I want to expand our understanding
of standard operating procedures by explaining their place in the context
of the philosophy of lean management. By the end of this video you'll be able
define the lean management philosophy, explain the main tools and techniques that
form the lean approach to management, and describe the importance of standard
operating procedures in the lean management philosophy. What is lean? Lean management,
sometimes called lean manufacturing, is an approach to operational management
that has its roots in the excellence of Japanese management methods,
particularly in Toyota and Honda. These management methods were studied in
the 1990s and resulted in many western companies adopting the tools and
techniques identified. The lean management philosophy is a great
illustration of the importance of standard operating procedures
to business success. Without the consistency and stability
created by the implementation of SOPs for critical activities, this approach to
operational excellence could not work. Called standard work in lean terminology,
standard operating procedures are one of the tools that
form the heart of lean management. But before we come on to them, let's
have a definition of lean management. The inspirational operations manager
Taiichi Ono is credited as one of the founders of the Toyota
production system, which later became called lean management. He also developed many of
the tools of lean management. In his book the Toyota production System, published in English in 1988,
Taiichi Ohno defined his approach as all we are doing is looking
at the timeline from the moment the customer gives us an order to
the point when we collect the cash and we are reducing the timeline by
reducing the non value adding wastes. This is a good definition of lean. It shows that lean management is
about improving business processes so that they deliver what the customer
requires more quickly by eliminating steps that do not benefit the customer. These non value adding
steps are called waste. Such wastes include things such
as handoffs between systems or teams, waiting for authorizations,
batching work requests, reworking faulty products and so on. Building on this definition, lean
management focuses on three key elements. One, delivering what
the customer actually wants and values from a process at the right
time and at the right price. Two, streamlining and smoothing
the process to consistently deliver that customer value with as few non
value adding steps as possible. And three, empowering the team to
continuously improve the process. I spent some time in a small
lean factory in Italy and what struck me about it
was the team spirit. Managers, supervisors and
operatives worked together with plenty of humor to tackle problems
that they were facing. There was no us and them culture, but a
desire to make things better for everyone. Lean is a collaborative
approach to management. It's not about making people
work harder or faster, it's about working together to
identify and remove inefficiencies from the process, unnecessary
steps over complicated elements, excessive layers of authorisation,
time delays and so on. In order to create the capacity to do more
profitable work in the time available. The tools of lean management. Lean management focuses on streamlining
business processes to make them more efficient and to improve quality. Work to implement a lean approach revolves
around seven key management tools. Standard work, lean management uses
standard operating procedures to ensure efficient processes that
consistently deliver customer value. Value stream mapping,
also called process mapping, to show how a process works
with all its twists and turns. Team problem solving,
the work team identifying and resolving problems in their
work area visual management, including performance measures displayed
in the work area and other visual cues. 5S, tools to create a clean,
well organised workplace kanban a visual method of controlling work
in progress to ensure a steady flow of work through a business
process without bottlenecks. Poka Yoke, which means mistake proofing. This is an important part of developing
standard operating procedures and I'll cover it in more
detail in a later video. New balance the sport shoes manufacturer
has used these techniques to cut work in progress by 80% whilst
improving manufacturing throughput and finished goods availability. Customer orders can be manufactured and
shipped within 24 hours, where they previously had
a nine day lead time. Although labour costs are significantly
higher in the United States than in Asia, the productivity gains made and
the ability to respond almost instantly to customer orders balance
out this difference. Standard work. In lean management,
SOPs are called standard work. Although increasingly in
workplaces applying lean concepts, the more user friendly phrase
one best way is applied. Standard work or one best way procedures
are one of the keys to efficient, high quality processes in
the lean management system. Standard work is developed in exactly
the same way as I have described for sops in the previous videos. They are the current best way
of carrying out an activity or process to deliver the quality
required by the customer efficiently. Lean management has a focus
on continuous improvement, which means that the standard
work is regularly reviewed and updated with the team in the work area to
identify more efficient ways of working. Standard work and
SOPs are essentially the same thing, although the emphasis on continuous
improvement may mean that standard work is more actively reviewed than SOPs
in some traditional organizations. In conclusion, lean management is
an approach to operational management that devolves a lot of
responsibility down to work teams. The focus is very much on delivering
what the customer wants with optimal efficiency. Workplace teams develop standard operating
procedures, which is called standard work, that focus on streamlining the process to
deliver quality, efficiency and safety. These procedures are regularly
reviewed with the work team, using problem solving tools to
see how they can be improved. The aim is to make every step in
the process a little better each time. All those small improvements add up to
large gains at the organizational level. A concept that is sometimes called
the doctrine of marginal gains. Now, I have a question for you. [MUSIC]
