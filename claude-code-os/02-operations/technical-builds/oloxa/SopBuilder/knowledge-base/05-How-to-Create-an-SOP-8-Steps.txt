In this video, I
present a method for developing standard
operating procedures. By the end of this video, you'll be able to
specify a structure for standard operating procedures
for your organization, start creating SOPs for your
own business processes. In the previous video, I discussed the features
of an effective SOP, the four situations
in which it's necessary to create SOPs, and the five elements that
every procedure needs, which are one, purpose, two, preparation,
including equipment, training, and safety
requirements, three, process flow chart or
step by step guide, four, checklist, five,
document control. Now we're ready to start work. I've written a lot of procedures
in my time and they're certainly not the place to be channeling your
inner Thomas Hardy. Your writing style
should be clear and precise with short sentences. Keep it simple and use
photographs, diagrams, and flow charts to avoid
text where possible. With that in mind, there are eight steps to creating an SOP. One, identify the activities and process steps that need a
standardized procedure. Use the audit tool from
the previous lesson and the four questions from the
previous lesson as a guide. Two, create an advisory
team or steering group. Gather a small group of
appropriate stakeholders, four or five people,
who will critique the SOP and advise on
what it should contain. I recommend two or three
people from the work area concerned plus the
area supervisor, and a representative from the quality department
with experience in SOPs. Three, agree the purpose
and scope of the SOP. Why is an SOP needed? How much of the activity or
process should it cover? The first section of
the SOP is its purpose. One or more of the
four reasons for an SOP will define
why it's necessary. Consistency, quality,
safety, or efficiency. Four, consider the needs
of the target audience. An SOP is a working document and its audience is the people
working the process, including trainees
and temporary staff. What format will
work best for them? How should the SOP be
structured and laid out to help them carry out
their work most effectively? Five, assess the risks
in the work area. Safety risks must be
highlighted in the SOP, along with the equipment needed to carry it out correctly, but we must also identify the
risks of poor performance. What can go wrong
in the process or activity and what
causes those problems? Those issues should
also be addressed in the SOP with appropriate
preventative measures. Six, draft the SOP. Prepare a draft
of the procedure, including photographs
of the steps, diagrams, and a flow
chart as appropriate. Review the draft with the SOP team and trial
it in the work area, asking the people who
work in the process to try it and comment
on its effectiveness. Seven, finalize and
document the SOP. Once the SOP has been trialed
and revised as necessary, it's ready to implement. It should be published in
the organization's record of procedures with appropriate document
control and sign offs. It should be used
in the work area as the one best way
of doing the job. All staff in the work area
should be trained in the SOP. Eight, review the SOP regularly. An SOP is only useful as
long as it remains valid. If new equipment is brought into the work area or methods change, then the SOP needs
to be revised. In addition, each SOP should be reviewed at least annually to ensure it continues to reflect best practice and that
it remains in use. I don't want to make the
whole process of creating and maintaining SOPs sound
too bureaucratic. Of course, once you
have procedures, you then have a
structured filing system of the SOPs in the organization, and you need a process of reviewing and revising
them as things change. But those things are
necessary because of the considerable benefits
that procedures offer, consistency of operations in areas where quality is vital, safe methods of working in situations where
the risks are real, efficiency, where components
or processes are costly, documented knowledge
of the best way of conducting a
task or activity, easy communication
of working methods, safety requirements, and other information, training materials
for new staff, the opportunity to
delegate tasks, knowing that methods
are defined. In conclusion, the standard
operating procedures that you create should be clear
and easily understood. They should communicate
the best, safest, and most efficient way of carrying out a task or activity. They should enable control
of the risks in the process, and they should be
accessible to and understandable by the
people in the work area. Importantly, they
should be reviewed regularly to ensure that
they remain relevant. There is nothing more useless
than an out of date SOP. In the next video,
I'll talk about monitoring and maintaining SOPs. Now I have a question for you.
