In this video, we discuss
leader standard work. That is standard
operating procedures for team leaders,
supervisors and managers. By the end of this video, you will be able to:
discuss the importance of having standard operating
procedures for team leaders, supervisors and managers,
called leader standard work. Describe the typical contents
of leader standard work. It's true in a
lien organization, supervisors and managers
have to follow SOPs too. But before you shut this video
down howling with disgust. Let's consider the benefits
of SOPs for managers. Efficient and safe
operations require standardized routines at all
levels of an organization. Consistency and an attention to detail are not only needed
within work processes, they're also needed at management
and supervisory levels. The gains of efficient
processes can be lost by inconsistent management. Managers are seen to be part of the same
discipline as operatives. This reduces the
resistance to SOPs. Clearly defined actions carried out regularly by managers and supervisors reinforce
the culture of continuous improvement
and teamworking. As I've said before, standard
operating procedures are only necessary for activities or processes that are safety, quality, or cost critical. The same applies to
leader standard work, meaning that not every part of a manager's or supervisor's
job is covered by an SOP, but rather the parts that
are critical to maintaining the stability and efficiency of the lean management system. Leader standard work therefore, provides the foundations
for effective management, but it does not specify or standardize the whole
of a manager's work. In fact, the leader standard
work will only apply to around 25 percent of
a manager's role. What does leader
standard work include? Leader standard work comprises the essential regular routines that are required to
maintain lean management. Typically, this breaks down into regular daily and weekly tasks. There may also be standard, monthly, quarterly or
annual tasks, too. In many organizations, you
will find that the daily tasks that make up the leader standard
work are called a DILO, which is short for a
day in the life of. The daily tasks, the DILO, will often include
the following: attending or facilitating
daily meetings, to check in with the team
and assess what's working, what needs attention, and how previous improvement
activities are progressing. This is sometimes called
a huddle meeting, reviewing visual
performance boards, praising work well done, and following up on issues. Presence in the process, observing how the work is going, speaking to staff,
to gauge the mood, assisting with problems,
and showing support. Safety checks to ensure equipment is being
used correctly, and protective clothing
is being worn, sample checks to ensure standard work is being applied
and remains effective. I recently worked in a large
financial services company that was implementing lean
management techniques. The focus of their initial
activity was to work with teams to simplify and
streamline work processes. This included training and
problem solving techniques, and setting up
improvement teams. Once the work processes
began to improve, the teams created
standard work procedures to ensure consistency
of operation. DILOs were introduced for
managers and team leaders. These centered on
daily meetings with the teams and support for
improvement activity. Senior managers had
their own DILOs, which involved attending some of the daily meetings and reviewing improvement activity to ensure the line managers
were doing their bit. As well as daily
leader standard work, there will usually be
regular weekly tasks specified for managers
and supervisors. These might include: involvement with continuous
improvement teams, to review work processes, eliminate errors,
and improve quality. Performance measurement,
analyzing trends, and identifying areas where improvement work may be needed, coaching, individual or
small group sessions, focusing on developing
an improvement culture, audits of standard work, as well as health
and safety audits, weekly reporting to
senior management on performance and progress, including details
of improvements made, and those planned. In conclusion,
leader standard work creates a regular routine for
managers and supervisors, covering the actions
that are essential to maintain a culture of
continuous improvement. These include facilitating
improvement meetings, encouraging the
identification and resolution of problems and inefficiencies
in the work process, and reviewing that standard
operating procedures remain valid and effective. Leader standard work
does not apply to the whole of a managers
or supervisors job. But it provides
the cornerstone of activities that are
necessary to maintain a safe and efficient
working environment that is striving towards
continuous improvement. Now, I have a question for you.
