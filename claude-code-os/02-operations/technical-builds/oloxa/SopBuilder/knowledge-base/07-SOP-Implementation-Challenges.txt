In this video, I discussed
the challenges of implementing standard operating procedures
in an organization. By the end of this video, you will be able to explain
the barriers which may be placed in the way of introducing SOPs into an organization, develop responses
to challenges and barriers raised against SOPs, design ways of retaining and
encouraging creativity and individuality in work whilst employing SOPs for
critical to cost, critical to safety, or
critical to quality steps. It's hard to pretend
that SOPs are a popular element of
organizational management. Successful business
people and the authors of the top-selling business books rarely credit their achievements
to operating procedures, and few managers are actively happy about having
to maintain SOPs. Yet we've seen how important
SOPs are to the smooth, efficient, and safe running
of a business process. They're not required for
every task or activity, but they are essential for
those critical to quality, critical to cost, or critical
to safety activities, which every organization has. The challenges you
may face, therefore, when seeking to implement
SOPs in a work area, are as follows: they
are overly complex. Badly written SOPs can be
long and unintelligible. The solution is to follow
the guidance in this course by creating simple
straightforward visual SOPs. Relegate documentation, specifications, and other
adjuncts to appendices, which can be easily accessed. They do not need to be bundled with the SOP in the work area. They are not user-friendly. If your SOPs are not
considered user-friendly, then you haven't worked hard enough to make them simple
to follow and apply. Get a team of people together, who know the process, and try again. They are ineffective. People who feel they
know the work required may ignore the SOP and
do things their own way. If this is true, then
the SOP does not reflect the easiest or most
efficient way of working. If the shortcuts being
used in the workplace are unacceptable for
safety or quality grounds, then they must be clearly
forbidden with reasons given, and anyone working that
way should be disciplined. They're out of date. An out-of-date SOP is
worse than useless. We've discussed the need to
keep SOPs up to date and how to monitor and maintain them in earlier videos
in this course. People feel hemmed in by them. I can understand this point. People don't like to
feel that they are robots programmed to do
the same thing each time. Perhaps tasks where this is truly the case need
to be automated. Keep your people for the tasks where skill and
judgment are needed. SOPs define the current best way of carrying out an activity or process but they cannot replace human experience
and expertise. Activities that are
quality or safety-critical need the people
working in them to be alert to emerging risks. The SOP can define the steps, but it cannot
replace experience. Explain to the people in the
process that the SOPs are the foundations for quality
and safety assurance, but their skills and
experience are vital to spot risks and to
deliver excellence. I think the biggest challenge to standard operating procedures is that people feel they stifle their creativity
and individuality and their flexibility to
respond to different issues. There are two answers
to this point. One, if a role does
need creativity and the ability to be flexible to a rise in customer
or business issues, then it probably
doesn't need an SOP. SOPs are about defining a repeatable routine activity
to ensure consistency, quality, and safety. We don't need SOPs
for creative tasks. There might be SOPs for some of the cornerstones of the work. For example, file
naming conventions, steps to go through
when recording a customer complaint, and so on. But we should not define the
whole activity through SOPs. Number 2, an activity or process may be safety
or quality critical, but it may also need
flexibility in performance. Again, SOPs may be used to cover the safety and quality
critical elements, but are not needed for the steps which need flexible
decision-making. Another approach which
works well is to stream the work into regular
work covered by an SOP, and irregular or special work where an SOP sets
the ground rules but experienced people provide the flexible decision-making and high-quality performance. I once worked in the cash office of a large city center hotel. This was essentially a large safe with four of us
locked inside all day. It got quite
claustrophobic at times. Each day we counted the cash collected in the hotels bars,
restaurants, and outlets, and we verified
electronic registers against the cash and
credit card payments made. Our role was partly the protection and management
of the hotel's revenues, partly management reporting, and partly validating
the performance of the staff operating
the registers. We had procedures for
counting cash and for verifying each other's
recording of cash. We also had
procedures for safely storing the cash and
electronic receipts, and we had procedures for the daily revenue
report to management. But we had discretion
when it came to discrepancies between
individual tellers and the cash and
receipts they submitted. It's not uncommon to
make mistakes when taking payments in a
busy bar or restaurant. I've done it myself, and we know we had good
hard-working staff. Usually, we call
the staff member in and discuss the
mistake with them. Sometimes there
were keying errors, which required more
training on the registers. Sometimes there were
cash-handling errors. No procedure could have covered the nuances of dealing with
people in this situation, and SOPs would not have helped. During my time there, we never had to
refer an employee for disciplinary action. SOPs covered the
essential security tasks but not the people
management elements. In conclusion, SOPs
are only needed where activities or tasks are safety, quality,
or cost-critical. The challenges of SOPs mostly relate to
poor implementation. Most tasks in a business don't
need operating procedures. If you keep that in mind, you'll be able to balance the need for standardization and control with the need for
flexibility and creativity. Now, I have a question for you.
