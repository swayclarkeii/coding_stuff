In this video, we offer
you some practice in creating a standard operating procedure with a case study. By the end of this video,
you will be able to identify processes
and activities for which SOPs are needed, and those which don't need SOPs. Conduct an audit of business activities to determine which require their own SOP. Our aim is to make this course
as practical as possible, and that includes
rehearsing the creation of a standard operating
procedure with a case study. Let's
make a start. Consider the following
three scenarios. Scenario 1, the
finance process for reviewing supplier invoices and approving them for payment. Scenario 2, the
cleaning of a staff changing room floor using
a floor polishing machine. Number three, the
movement of boxes of stationery from the receiving
area to a store cupboard. Only one of these activities needs a standard
operating procedure. Do you know which one it is, and why don't the other
activities need an SOP? Pause the video here for a moment if you
need time to think. We have three
business activities, a finance process,
a cleaning process, and a manual handling process. Which needs an SOP? Well, it's the finance process. Let me explain why. In the first lesson
in this video, I mentioned the three watchwords for standard
operating procedures, efficiency, quality, and safety. I'll go into more detail about when we need an SOP
in the next lesson, but essentially, it's to meet one or more
of these criteria. The finance process, reviewing supplier invoices and
approving them for payment matches two of these criteria,
quality and safety. I'm using safety in a
broad sense here to include risk and
specifically financial risk. Invoice fraud is the biggest single financial
fraud in business. A Llyods bank survey
identified that 52% of UK businesses had experienced to invoice fraud or
attempted fraud. About 37% of businesses lacked checks to
prevent invoice fraud. There is a significant risk from invoice fraud and therefore, a rigorous operating
procedure is needed for the process to ensure that checks are carried
out thoroughly. Any staff undertaking this role need to be fully trained
in the procedure. I can understand
that you might argue that the operation of the
floor polishing machine would require an SOP because there is a potential safety risk from electricity or
inappropriate use. That would be true.
There will be a standard operating
procedure for cleaning staff that covers safe use of all the
machines that they operate, and the chemicals they may use. But there does not need to be a separate specific
procedure for polishing the
changing room floor or any other
specific floor area. I apologize if you think
I'm being pedantic there. But my question was specifically about cleaning the
changing room floor. That does not need its own SOP. The procedure for the
safe operation of cleaning machinery will cover
it for all applications. Similarly, a case
might be made for the manual movement of
boxes of stationery. But again, this
would be covered by a general safe
handling procedure for all staff that would cover all manual handling
requirements. There doesn't need to be
a specific procedure for moving boxes from the receiving
area to the storeroom. I hope you understand the
distinction I'm making here. Individual processes,
activities, and tasks which have specific risks or requirements will need their own standard
operating procedure. But generalized tasks,
such as manual handling or operating equipment that is used in a range
of activities, can be covered by general health and safety procedures
and training. Your first task, therefore, in preparing for
the introduction of standard operating procedures
is to determine which activities need their
own specific SOPs and which can be covered by general procedures
and training. It might be useful to
audit the processes and activities carried
out in your company, speaking to the people
that work in them. For each process, task, or activity identified, we
would ask four questions. One, is the activity expensive to operate or use
expensive materials? Two, is the quality
of the output of the activity or
process critical? Three, is the process
or activity high risk, safety risk, financial risk, reputational risk, and so on. Four, does the risk
in the process or activity apply across
a range of activities? If there is an
affirmative answer to any of the first
three questions, then an SOP is needed for
that process or activity. If there is a negative
answer to all of the first three
questions, cost, quality, or specific risk,
then the activity or process probably doesn't
need its own SOP. Although, this is a
subjective judgment, and the final decision should be made by
the management team. If there is a negative answer to all of the first
three questions, but the fourth question
has an affirmative answer, then a specific SOP is not needed for the
processor activity. But there does need to be
a generalized procedure to cover the broader risk. Such general safety briefings are common in all organizations, manual handling, the use
of cleaning materials, electrical equipment
awareness, and so on. However, the judgment on
risk is important and if you think the risk may be increased in this
specific activity, then a specific SOP
would be appropriate. In conclusion, judging
whether a business process or activity needs a standard operating
procedure can be tricky, and we'll return to this
topic in the next lesson. In broad terms,
processes and activities with specific concerns
relating to cost, quality, and safety or risk
will need their own SOP. General safety procedures and training can cover
risks that feature across the business and are not specific to any particular area. Now, I have a question for you.
