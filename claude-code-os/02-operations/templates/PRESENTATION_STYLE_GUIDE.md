# Presentation Style Guide

## Core Principle
**Sway speaks to slides, not reads from them.**

Slides are prompts for conversation, not scripts. Keep everything scannable and brief.

---

## Formatting Rules

### 1. Bullet Points Over Paragraphs
**Never use paragraphs.** Always use bullet points.

❌ Bad:
```
€150,000 in outstanding client payments, with €100,000 overdue by more than 30 days. Late invoicing and no systematic follow-up delays collection.
```

✅ Good:
```
• €100K overdue 30+ days
• No systematic follow-up
• Late invoicing delays collection
```

### 2. Hierarchy with Sub-bullets
Use title + sub-bullets pattern:

```
Outstanding Client Payments
• €100K overdue 30+ days
• No systematic follow-up
• Late invoicing delays collection
```

### 3. Short Descriptions
- Max 3-4 bullets per section
- Max 8-10 words per bullet
- No complete sentences needed - fragments are fine

### 4. Numbers First
Lead with the metric/number when possible:
- "€100K overdue" not "Overdue amount of €100K"
- "15-25 invoices/week" not "Between 15 and 25 invoices per week"
- "10% error rate" not "An error rate of approximately 10%"

### Recap/Context Slide

### Discoveries/Pain Points

### Questions Slide
Numbered questions, one line each:
```
[ 1 ] What's your perspective on these operational challenges?
[ 2 ] Are there pain points from the recruitment side I should understand?
[ 3 ] How do you see AI and automation fitting into Ambush's future direction?
```

### Discussion Points
Numbered, statement format (not questions):
```
# 1  Which of these challenges feels most urgent to address
# 2  Who else should be involved in decisions about next steps
# 3  Timeline for deciding how to proceed
```

### Thank You Slide
- Large "THANK YOU!"
- Company name
- Brief personalized message (1-2 lines)
