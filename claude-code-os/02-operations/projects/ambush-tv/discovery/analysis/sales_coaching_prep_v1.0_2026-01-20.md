# Sales Coaching Prep - Ambush TV Alignment Call

**Created:** 2026-01-20
**Purpose:** Prepare questions and context for sales coaching session before alignment call with Sindbad
**Status:** Pre-proposal / Alignment Phase

---

## The Deal at a Glance

**Client:** Sindbad Iksel (co-founder of Ambush TV - pitch presentation business in Paris)
**Business:** 50 projects/month, 70-80 freelancers, weekly payment cycles
**Revenue significance:** 90% of Sindbad's income

### The Pain

| Who | Pain Point | Time Cost |
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| Sindbad | Manual invoice validation | 5.5 hrs/week (22 hrs/month) |
| Leonor (admin) | Manual rate sync across 3 sheets | 2+ hrs/month |
| Admin team | No project close-out reminders | Invoices delayed 1-2 months |

**Error rate:** ~10% of invoices have issues (missing projects, rate discrepancies)

### The Big Number

**€150,000 outstanding receivables** - €100K of that is overdue >30 days. This is the real leverage point, not just time savings.

### The Budget Gap

- **Sindbad's initial expectation:** €2-3K ("for automation that saves 20+ hours/month")
- **Minimum viable package:** €8K
- **Full solution:** €20K-25K
- **His qualifier:** "We'd be prepared to pay substantially more of course, as long as we're confident it would help rather than bring more complexity or bugs"

### Key Constraints

1. **Pierre approval required** - business partner handles recruitment, Sindbad handles finances, but both must approve significant investments
2. **Partnership tension** - diverging visions, Pierre started separate AI business
3. **Trust concern** - Sindbad wants human-in-the-loop, not blind automation

## Questions for Sales Coach

### On Positioning & Framing

1. **How do I bridge the €2-3K expectation to an €8K minimum without sticker shock?** He said "substantially more" for the full admin chain - but what's the best way to frame that scope difference without making him feel like I'm upselling?

2. **Should I lead with the €150K outstanding money or the time savings?** The outstanding money is 10x the annual time savings value - but it's also more abstract. What's the better anchor?

3. **How do I position this as "alignment call" vs "proposal presentation"?** I want to make sure we're aligned before I throw numbers at him - but I also don't want to seem unprepared.

### On Stakeholder Dynamics

4. **How do I get Pierre in the room (or get buy-in without him)?** Sindbad handles finances but said he needs Pierre's approval for budget. I've never spoken to Pierre. Should I ask Sindbad to bring him to the call, or close Sindbad first and let him sell Pierre?

5. **Given the partnership tension, should I avoid the topic entirely or acknowledge it somehow?** Sindbad mentioned they don't share the same vision anymore. Is this a landmine or an opportunity?

### On Pricing Strategy

6. **Should I present options (€8K / €20K) or anchor on one number?** I have a minimum viable €8K package and a full €20K-25K solution. Do I present both and let him choose, or anchor high and negotiate?

7. **How do I handle "can we start smaller"?** The €8K is already my minimum. If he pushes for €5K, do I cut scope or hold the line?

8. **What's the right payment structure for trust-building?** 50/50 upfront/completion feels standard, but is there a structure that reduces perceived risk for a skeptical buyer?

### On Closing

9. **What's a realistic close timeline here?** Discovery has taken 2 weeks with 5 calls. Is another alignment call + proposal review reasonable, or am I dragging this out?

10. **What objections should I prepare for that I might not see coming?** I've prepped for "too expensive" and "can we start smaller" - what else trips people up at this stage?

## Current Approach Summary

**Lead with:**
- The €150K outstanding money as the value driver
- Anchor on €8K minimum viable to bridge the budget gap
- Emphasize pilot approach + human-in-the-loop to address trust concerns
- Get clarity on Pierre involvement before throwing numbers

**Uncertain about:**
- Whether to push for Pierre in the call or let Sindbad champion internally
- How aggressive to be on pricing (hold the line vs. negotiate down)
- Whether the alignment call is the right frame or if you should go straight to proposal
