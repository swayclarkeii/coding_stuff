# Sindbad's Responses to Verification Questions

**Date received:** January 19, 2026
**Context:** Follow-up to discovery calls to verify ROI assumptions

---

## Time & Volume

**Q: You mentioned 5-6 hours/week on invoice validation - is that still accurate?**

> "Yes, maybe even a bit more if you add conversations about anything that wasn't quite right and asking freelancers to correct mistakes"

**Status:** ✅ Verified at 5-6+ hours/week

---

**Q: You mentioned also 15-20 payouts per week - still valid?**

> "Yes"

**Status:** ✅ Verified at 15-20 payouts/week

---

## Value of Time

**Q: For ROI purposes, what would you say is a fair hourly rate for your time?**

> "Hard to estimate but maybe 50 euros per hour. Not because it's particularly hard work but it requires a good knowledge of the business and meticulosity."

**Status:** ✅ Verified at €50/hour (not €100 as assumed)

---

**Q: What is the approximate hours wage of your staff? And how many hours do they work combined per week?**

> "If you count the admin team only, I would say about 20 euros per hour and about 80 to 100 hours per week, for the creative team (ADs and assistant ADs) it's quite a bit more, and they deal with bookings on the weekend fyi."

**Status:** ✅ Verified
- Admin team: €20/hour, 80-100 hours/week combined
- Creative team: Higher rate, weekend work

---

## Errors & Costs

**Q: When you catch invoice errors, what's the typical euro amount involved?**

> "It depends a lot but can be up to 300 euros, usually much less. But to me it's important for them to know we're keeping an eye so they know they shouldn't attempt to trick us"

**Status:** ✅ Verified
- Range: €50-300 (up to €300, usually much less)
- Non-financial value: Deterrent effect on fraud

---

**Q: Roughly how much outstanding money is currently owed to Ambush from clients?**

> "150 000 euros (100 000 is more than 30 days old, about 50K is less than 30 days old)"

**Status:** ✅ Verified
- Total outstanding: €150,000
- >30 days old: €100,000
- <30 days old: €50,000

**Critical insight:** This is a massive cash flow issue that automation could help address.

---

## Budget

**Q: What budget range would you consider reasonable for automation that saves 20+ hours/month?**

> "Are we talking about a one-off payment? I honestly don't know but €2-3K maybe (but I'm not realising how much work would go into it so don't want to be unfair)? But my understanding is that you would propose tools that would help the whole admin chain. For that, we'd be prepared to pay substantially more of course, as long as we're confident that it would help rather than bring more complexity or bugs"

**Status:** ✅ Verified budget expectations
- Initial expectation: €2-3K for time savings only
- Open to more: "Substantially more" for full admin chain automation
- Key concern: Confidence that it helps vs. adds complexity/bugs

**Strategic insight:** Budget is flexible if value is clear and risk is managed.

**Q: Do you and Pierre need to approve all investments above a certain amount?**

> "Yes"

**Status:** ✅ Verified - Both Sindbad and Pierre must approve

## Key Insights from Responses

### 1. Hourly Value Is Lower Than Assumed
- Sindbad: €50/hr (not €100/hr)
- Admin team: €20/hr (not €50/hr)
- **Impact:** Time-based ROI is half of what we calculated

### 2. Outstanding Money Is the Real Leverage
- €150K outstanding (€100K overdue >30 days)
- This is the elephant in the room
- Cash flow automation could unlock this money faster than manual tracking

### 3. Budget Expectations Are Low But Flexible
- Initial thought: €2-3K for time savings
- But open to "substantially more" for full admin chain
- Need to justify higher investment with comprehensive value (not just time savings)

### 4. Risk Aversion Is High
- "As long as we're confident it would help rather than bring more complexity or bugs"
- Trust and proof are critical
- Pilot/proof-of-concept approach makes sense

### 5. Error Prevention Has Non-Financial Value
- "Important for them to know we're keeping an eye so they shouldn't attempt to trick us"
- Deterrent effect matters beyond pure error cost
- Quality control is about relationships and trust
