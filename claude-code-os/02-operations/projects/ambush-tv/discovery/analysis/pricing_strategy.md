# Ambush TV - Pricing & Packaging Strategy

**Created:** 2026-01-18
**Source:** 5 Discovery Transcripts (Jan 8 & Jan 15, 2026)
**Purpose:** Pricing options and packaging for proposal

---

## Executive Summary

Based on discovery insights, Ambush TV requires a phased approach with clear value milestones. Budget sensitivity exists (Sindbad mentioned being "tight"), but Ambush generates 90% of revenue and has clear ROI justification.

**Recommended Approach:** Value-based pricing with phased delivery
**Total Project Value:** €20,000-35,000
**Monthly Time Savings:** 20-25 hours
**ROI Timeline:** 8-14 months payback

## Pricing Insights from Discovery

### Budget Context

**Direct Quotes:**
- "Cutting costs at every corner" - Madalena
- Discord instead of Slack (free vs €7/user/month)
- Google Workspace Free (no Notion, no paid CRM)
- Abandoned Fireflies/Otter when hit free limits

**However:**
- Ambush is profitable (90% of Sindbad's revenue)
- 70-80 freelancers with weekly payments (significant cash flow)
- Recently raised prices (testing market elasticity)
- Reinforced core team (9 people, higher costs)
- Word-of-mouth driven, demand exceeds capacity

**Interpretation:**
Budget-conscious but not broke. Free tool preference is cultural (scrappy startup mentality), not financial necessity. Clear ROI justification will unlock budget.

---

### Decision Makers

**Sindbad:** Handles all finances, primary decision maker for Ambush
**Pierre:** Business partner, may need to approve significant investments
**Admin Team:** Stakeholders, need buy-in but not budget authority

**From Jan 15 call:**
> "I'll talk to Pierre about it... We need to bring him in for the budget discussion."

**Implication:**
Sindbad can likely approve quick wins (<€10K) independently. Larger investments may require Pierre's agreement.

### Value Anchor Points

> **✅ VERIFIED DATA** (Responses received Jan 19, 2026)
> - See `sindbad_responses.md` for full Q&A
> - All calculations below use verified rates from Sindbad

**Time Cost (Sindbad):**

```
FORMULA:
Monthly value = [hours/week] × 4 × [hourly rate]
              = 5.5 × 4 × €50 = €1,100/month

Annual value = €1,100 × 12 = €13,200/year
```

| Variable | Value Used | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Hours/week | 5.5 hours | ✅ Verified (Sindbad) |
| Hourly rate | **€50/hour** | ✅ Verified (Sindbad) |

**Verified calculation:**
- 5.5 hours/week invoice validation = 22 hours/month
- Verified hourly rate: **€50/hour**
- Monthly value: **€1,100**
- Annual value: **€13,200**

---

**Time Cost (Admin Team):**

```
FORMULA:
Monthly value = [total admin hours] × [admin hourly rate]
              = 5 hours × €20 = €100/month

Annual value = €100 × 12 = €1,200/year
```

| Variable | Value Used | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Rate sync hours | 2.5 hours/month | ✅ Verified (Leonor) |
| Project tracking | 2.5 hours/month | ⚠️ Estimate |
| Admin hourly rate | **€20/hour** | ✅ Verified (Sindbad) |
| Total admin hours/week | 80-100 hours | ✅ Verified (Sindbad) |

**Verified calculation:**
- Rate sync verification: 2.5 hours/month
- Project tracking: 2.5 hours/month
- Total: 5 hours/month
- Verified rate: **€20/hour**
- Monthly value: **€100**
- Annual value: **€1,200**

---

**Error Prevention:**

```
FORMULA:
Monthly error cost = [errors/month] × [avg error cost]
                   = 5 × €150 = €750/month

Annual value = €750 × 12 = €9,000/year
```

| Variable | Value Used | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Projects/month | ~50 | ✅ Verified |
| Error rate | ~10% | ✅ Verified (Sindbad) |
| Errors caught/month | 5 | ✅ Calculated (50 × 0.10) |
| Avg error cost | **€150** | ✅ Verified (Sindbad: €50-300, usually less) |

**Verified calculation:**
- 10% invoice error rate across 50 projects/month
- 5 errors caught per month
- Average error cost: **€150** (conservative mid-range)
- Monthly value: **€750**
- Annual value: **€9,000**

**Non-financial value (from Sindbad):**
> "It's important for them to know we're keeping an eye so they shouldn't attempt to trick us"
- Deterrent effect on intentional fraud
- Maintains quality standards across 70-80 freelancers

---

**Outstanding Money Collection:**

**🚨 CRITICAL NEW DATA POINT**

```
FORMULA:
Direct cost = [overdue amount] × [cost of capital]
            = €100,000 × 0.05 = €5,000/year

Opportunity cost = Cash flow constraints limit growth
```

| Variable | Value Used | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Total outstanding | **€150,000** | ✅ Verified (Sindbad) |
| Overdue >30 days | **€100,000** | ✅ Verified (Sindbad) |
| Recent <30 days | **€50,000** | ✅ Verified (Sindbad) |

**Verified calculation:**
- Total outstanding: **€150,000**
- Seriously overdue (>30 days): **€100,000**
- Direct cost (5% annually): **€5,000/year**
- Indirect costs: Strategic initiatives delayed, manual tracking burden

**What this means:**
This is the **highest-value opportunity**. The €150K outstanding is ~10x larger than the annual time-savings value. Automation that helps collect this faster has enormous ROI.

---

**Total Annual Value (Verified):**

```
FORMULA:
Total = Sindbad time + Admin time + Error prevention + Cash flow
      = €13,200 + €1,200 + €9,000 + €5,000

TOTAL = €28,400/year
```

**Breakdown:**
- Sindbad time savings: **€13,200/year**
- Admin time savings: **€1,200/year**
- Error prevention: **€9,000/year**
- Outstanding money cost: **€5,000/year** (conservative)
- **Total annual value: €28,400**

---

## Critical Budget Insight

**Sindbad's initial thought:** €2-3K for invoice automation only

> "Are we talking about a one-off payment? I honestly don't know but €2-3K maybe (but I'm not realising how much work would go into it so don't want to be unfair)?"

**Context:** This was his response to "What budget range would you consider reasonable for automation that saves 20+ hours/month?" - focused on HIS time savings only.

---

**But for the full admin chain, he's open to substantially more:**

> "But my understanding is that you would propose tools that would help the whole admin chain. For that, we'd be prepared to pay substantially more of course, as long as we're confident that it would help rather than bring more complexity or bugs"

**Translation:**
- €2-3K = Just solving Sindbad's invoice validation pain
- "Substantially more" = Full admin chain automation (rate sync, calendar reminders, outstanding money tracking, etc.)

**Critical point:** He's NOT expecting the full €20K-25K solution for €2-3K. He explicitly said "substantially more" for the comprehensive approach.

---

**Key concerns (regardless of budget):**
1. **Confidence that it helps** (not adds complexity)
2. **Avoid bugs**
3. **Need Pierre approval**

---

**Pricing strategy implications:**
- **DON'T lead with €20K-25K upfront** - sticker shock vs. his €2-3K reference point
- **DO explain the scope difference:**
  - €2-3K scope = Just invoice validation time savings
  - €8K-25K scope = Full admin chain + cash flow + error prevention + team efficiency
- **DO lead with value story:** €150K outstanding + €28K annual value + admin chain transformation
- **DO anchor on €8K minimum viable** - proves concept, closer to his reference point, bridges to full solution
- **DO emphasize pilot approach** - directly addresses "confidence" and "bugs" concerns
- **DO prepare Pierre-focused pitch** - needs both to approve, show financial + strategic ROI

## Objection Handling

### "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
"Let's break down the math. Sindbad spends 20+ hours/month on invoice validation. At €100/hour (conservative for founder time), that's €2,000/month, €24,000/year. The full investment pays back in under 12 months, then it's pure savings. For the quick wins package at €6,500, payback is 2-4 months."

### "Can we start smaller?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely. The quick wins package at €6,500 is designed exactly for that. It delivers value in 4-6 weeks, proves the approach works, and builds confidence for Phase 2. There's no commitment beyond Phase 1."

### "We can build this ourselves"

**Response:**
"You could, and Madalena has done great work with ChatGPT and formulas. The question is opportunity cost. How many hours would Madalena spend building vs. having it delivered in 4-6 weeks? Those are hours not spent on client work or other priorities. Plus, we bring proven patterns from similar projects."

### "What if it doesn't work?"

**Response:**
"Phase 1 is low-risk: well-documented APIs, proven patterns, 4-week delivery. We'll know quickly if the approach works. If Phase 1 doesn't deliver value, there's no obligation for Phase 2. We're confident enough to stake our reputation on it."

### "We need Pierre's approval"

**Response:**
"Understood. Would it help to have a brief call with Pierre to walk through the ROI analysis? Or we could start with Phase 1 (€6,500) which may be within Sindbad's approval authority, then bring Pierre in for Phase 2 once we've proven value."

### Payment Terms: €8,000
- 50% upfront: €4,000
- 50% on completion: €4,000
- Timeline: 4-5 weeks

### ROI Calculation (€8K Package) - VERIFIED DATA

**Formula:**
```
Sindbad time saved:
- Invoice pre-check: 11 hrs/month (50% reduction from 22 hrs)
- Value: 11 × €50 = €550/month

Admin time saved:
- Rate sync: 2.5 hrs/month
- Value: 2.5 × €20 = €50/month

Error prevention:
- Estimated: €400/month (reduced from €750 with partial automation)

Total monthly value = €550 + €50 + €400 = €1,000/month
Annual value = €12,000/year

Payback = €8,000 ÷ €1,000 = 8 months
```

**Verified calculation using Sindbad's rates:**
- **Sindbad time value:** €550/month (11 hrs × €50/hr)
- **Admin time value:** €50/month (2.5 hrs × €20/hr)
- **Error prevention:** €400/month (conservative)
- **Total monthly value:** €1,000
- **Payback period:** 8 months
- **First year net value:** €4,000 (€12K value - €8K investment)

### Upgrade Path

**From €8K to Full Solution:**
- €8K package proves the approach works
- Phase 2 becomes: €10,000-12,000 (delta to full system)
- Total investment: €18,000-20,000
- But risk is reduced: Phase 1 validated first

### Positioning

**How to present €8K package:**

> "We can start with an €8,000 package that focuses on the highest-impact automations: rate synchronization and invoice pre-validation. This won't eliminate all manual work, but it will cut Sindbad's invoice review time in half and create the foundation for full automation later. It's a lower-risk way to prove the value before a larger investment."
