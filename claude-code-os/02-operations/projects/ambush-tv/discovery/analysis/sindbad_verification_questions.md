## Section 1: Time Spent on Invoice Validation

**Current estimate:** 5-6 hours/week (20-24 hours/month)

**Questions to verify:**

1. **Weekly time spent on invoice validation**
   - "On average, how many hours per week do you spend reviewing freelancer invoices?"
   - Follow-up: "Is this consistent week-to-week, or does it vary by month?"

2. **Volume of invoices**
   - "How many individual invoices do you review per week on average?"
   - Current estimate: 15-20 per week

3. **Time per invoice**
   - "For a typical invoice that has no issues, how long does it take you to validate?"
   - "For an invoice with a discrepancy, how long does resolution take?"

4. **Error frequency**
   - "Roughly what percentage of invoices have some kind of issue?"
   - Current estimate: ~10%
   - "What are the most common types of errors you catch?"

## Section 2: Rate Management Time

**Current estimate:** 2-3 hours/month verification

**Questions to verify:**

1. **Rate change frequency**
   - "How often do freelancer rates change? Per month?"
   - Current estimate: 5-10 rate changes per month

2. **Batch raises**
   - "When you do batch raises (multiple freelancers at once), how many typically happen at one time?"
   - "How often do batch raises happen?"

3. **Verification time**
   - "When Leonor updates rates, do you independently verify they're correct across all sheets?"
   - "If so, how much time does that verification take?"

## Section 3: Value of Your Time

**For ROI calculation, we need to understand the opportunity cost.**

1. **Alternative activities**
   - "If you weren't doing invoice validation, what would you be doing instead?"
   - "You mentioned Bold Move TV and screenplay writing - what's the revenue/value potential there?"

2. **Billing rate benchmark**
   - "For strategic consulting work or other client work, what's your typical hourly rate?"
   - This helps us calculate the true cost of admin time
   - Note: We don't need an exact number - even a range (e.g., €75-125/hour) helps

3. **Growth constraints**
   - "Is invoice validation limiting your ability to take on new work or grow Bold Move TV?"

---

## Section 4: Error Cost & Cash Flow

1. **Underbilling frequency**
   - "When you catch errors, how often are they underbillings (freelancer invoiced less than they should have)?"
   - "How often are they overbillings (freelancer invoiced more than they should have)?"

2. **Error cost range**
   - "When there's a rate or hours error, what's the typical euro amount involved?"
   - "What's the largest error you've caught in the past year?"

3. **Outstanding money**
   - "You mentioned there's outstanding money from clients. Roughly how much is currently owed to Ambush?"
   - "What's the typical delay between project completion and payment?"

4. **Cash flow impact**
   - "Does the time spent on invoice validation ever delay freelancer payments?"
   - "Has invoice processing ever created cash flow stress for the business?"

---

## Section 5: Tool & Process Questions

1. **Invoice format**
   - "Are all freelancer invoices in the same format, or does each freelancer have their own template?"
   - "What format are most invoices? PDF? Google Doc? Something else?"

2. **Wise usage**
   - "Do you use Wise for all freelancer payments, or are there exceptions?"
   - "Do you do individual transfers or batch payments?"

3. **Dashboard accuracy**
   - "Before you review an invoice, how confident are you that the Dashboard data is correct?"
   - "When there's a mismatch, is it usually the invoice that's wrong, or the Dashboard?"

4. **Current error detection**
   - "What's your process for catching errors? What do you check first?"
   - "Are there any automations or formulas you currently use to flag potential issues?"

---

## Section 6: Budget & Investment

1. **Budget availability**
   - "For automation that saves 20+ hours/month, what budget range would you consider reasonable?"
   - Anchor options: €5K-10K for quick wins, €15K-25K for full solution

2. **Decision process**
   - "For investments in this range, do you make the decision yourself, or does Pierre need to approve?"
   - "What would you need to see to feel confident about this investment?"

3. **Payment preferences**
   - "Do you prefer upfront payment, milestone-based, or monthly?"
   - "Would a smaller proof-of-concept project (€5K-8K) be easier to approve?"

---

## Section 7: Success Criteria

1. **Time savings goal**
   - "If we could reduce your invoice validation time from 5-6 hours/week to 1-2 hours/week, would that be transformative?"
   - "What's the minimum time savings that would make this worthwhile?"

2. **Control requirements**
   - "Do you want to approve every payment, or would you trust a system that flagged only exceptions?"
   - "What would make you comfortable with a human-in-the-loop approval system?"

3. **Timeline expectations**
   - "If we started this project, when would you want to see initial results?"
   - "Is there a deadline (e.g., end of quarter) that's important for this?"
