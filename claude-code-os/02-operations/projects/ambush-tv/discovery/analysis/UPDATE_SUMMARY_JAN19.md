# Discovery Updates Summary - January 19, 2026

## What Changed

All discovery documentation has been updated with **verified data** from Sindbad's responses.

---

## 🔴 Critical New Data Points

### 1. Outstanding Money (BIGGEST FINDING)
- **Total outstanding:** €150,000
- **Overdue >30 days:** €100,000
- **Recent <30 days:** €50,000

**Impact:** This is the highest-value opportunity. The ROI story is no longer just about time savings - it's about collecting €150K faster.

### 2. Hourly Rates (Lower Than Assumed)
- **Sindbad:** €50/hour (was assumed €100/hour)
- **Admin team:** €20/hour (was assumed €50/hour)

**Impact:** Time-based ROI is 50% lower than initially calculated, BUT error prevention and cash flow value are much higher.

### 3. Budget Expectations
- **Initial thought:** €2-3K for invoice automation only
- **But open to more:** "Substantially more" for full admin chain automation
- **Requires:** Both Sindbad AND Pierre approval

**Impact:** Don't lead with €20K-25K pricing. Anchor on €8K minimum viable, explain scope difference.

### 4. Key Concerns
1. "Confidence it would help rather than bring more complexity or bugs"
2. Avoid adding bugs
3. Need Pierre approval

**Impact:** Emphasize pilot approach, human-in-the-loop, clear rollback plan.

## ROI Summary Comparison

### Before Verification (Assumptions)
- Sindbad hourly rate: €100/hour
- Admin hourly rate: €50/hour
- Annual value: €26K-35K (estimated)
- Outstanding money: Unknown

### After Verification (Real Data)
- Sindbad hourly rate: **€50/hour** ↓ 50%
- Admin hourly rate: **€20/hour** ↓ 60%
- Annual value: **€28,400** (verified)
- Outstanding money: **€150,000** (€100K overdue) ← CRITICAL

**Net effect:** Lower hourly rates reduce time-based ROI, BUT outstanding money is the real opportunity.

## What This Means for the Proposal

### OLD PITCH (Before Verification):
"Automation saves you 20 hours/month, worth €24K-28K annually. Investment: €20K-25K. Payback: 10-12 months."

### NEW PITCH (After Verification):
"You have €150K outstanding from clients—€100K overdue more than 30 days. That's costing you €5K/year minimum, plus strategic opportunities you can't pursue.

Automation helps you:
1. Collect that €150K faster with systematic reminders
2. Save €13K/year in Sindbad's time
3. Prevent €9K/year in billing errors
4. Free up cash flow for Bold Move TV growth

We can start with an €8K package that proves the value in 8 months, then expand to full solution. Or go full scope for €20K-25K with 11-14 month payback."

## Budget Positioning Strategy

**Sindbad's perspective:**
- "€2-3K for automation that saves 20+ hours/month" ← His time only
- "Substantially more for tools that help the whole admin chain" ← Open to higher investment

**How to bridge the gap:**

1. **Explain scope difference:**
   - €2-3K scope = Just invoice validation time savings
   - €8K scope = Rate sync + invoice pre-check + Fathom + error prevention
   - €20K-25K scope = Full admin chain + outstanding money tracking + cash flow optimization

2. **Lead with value, not time:**
   - €150K outstanding (10x the annual time value)
   - €28K annual recurring value
   - Admin chain transformation (not just Sindbad's time)

3. **Address concerns proactively:**
   - "As long as we're confident it would help rather than bring more complexity or bugs"
   - Solution: Pilot approach, human-in-the-loop, clear rollback plan

4. **Prepare for Pierre:**
   - Both must approve
   - Show financial ROI (€150K collection) + strategic ROI (time for Bold Move TV)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Draft proposal** using new verified numbers
2. **Emphasize €150K outstanding money** as primary value driver
3. **Position €8K package** as proof-of-concept before full commitment
4. **Prepare Pierre-focused materials** showing financial + strategic value
