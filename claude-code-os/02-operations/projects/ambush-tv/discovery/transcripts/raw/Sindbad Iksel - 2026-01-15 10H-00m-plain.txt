[00:00:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: So yeah, we see each other a lot these days.
[00:00:02] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's good.
[00:00:03] sindbad ambushed.tv: Hopefully we'll meet in person in a, you know, you don't, how often do you come to Amsterdam, by the way?
[00:00:09] sindbad ambushed.tv: Is that, no, never really, right?
[00:00:11] sindbad ambushed.tv: You were just there for your friends thing, right?
[00:00:13] Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:14] Sway Clarke: I mean, but hey, if we're working together, we're going to come out there and check, check out what's going on.
[00:00:18] Sway Clarke: I've got to come out and say what's up.
[00:00:20] Sway Clarke: No, but I don't, I don't get out there too often.
[00:00:22] Sway Clarke: Hi Madalena.
[00:00:23] Sway Clarke: How are you?
[00:00:25] sindbad ambushed.tv: How are you doing?
[00:00:26] Sway Clarke: I'm good, thanks.
[00:00:28] Sway Clarke: I'm good, I'm good.
[00:00:28] Sway Clarke: So yeah, this is Sway.
[00:00:30] sindbad ambushed.tv: Just to give you a bit of context, we met in Amsterdam.
[00:00:34] sindbad ambushed.tv: Laura was, well, there was an opening at the museum where she works.
[00:00:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: Sway was here to visit a friend and yeah, he's a, used to be a musician and now has created this little company making, helping people implement AI in their businesses.
[00:00:50] sindbad ambushed.tv: So yeah, I could have waited actually to, because Leonor and Alice are joining us, right?
[00:00:55] sindbad ambushed.tv: I'll let you- there.
[00:00:57] sindbad ambushed.tv: Thank you for this.
[00:00:58] sindbad ambushed.tv: Uh huh.
[00:01:03] sindbad ambushed.tv: And they both have the link, they should be here soon.
[00:01:09] sindbad ambushed.tv: So Madalena basically, hi Alice, good morning.
[00:01:18] sindbad ambushed.tv: Good morning.
[00:01:20] Alice Carreto: They're all from Portugal, but they all speak incredible English.
[00:01:24] sindbad ambushed.tv: It is impressive.
[00:01:26] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Imagine we didn't and we just had to sit on this meeting like smiling and nodding.
[00:01:33] Alice Carreto: That would be awkward.
[00:01:35] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, I mean, I think Madalena to me sounds more American than English, but interestingly, your point of view.
[00:01:43] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Alice and I went to the same school growing up, and then we were both in London studying at the same time.
[00:01:48] Alice Carreto: I think the American thing comes from like movies, Hollywood, you know, there's like this sort of international accent where it's not quite British.
[00:01:59] Alice Carreto: discussions just for the questions.
[00:02:00] Alice Carreto: It's also not quite American, but if anything, it falls more on the American spectrum than on the British, I think, because Hollywood.
[00:02:09] Alice Carreto: Definitely.
[00:02:10] sindbad ambushed.tv: Here's an interesting question I was asking myself, well, talking to a friend, actually.
[00:02:16] sindbad ambushed.tv: Do you think Trump's crazy, you know, policies are going to affect also Hollywood?
[00:02:23] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, are people going to still want to see  from America or they're going be like, we're done.
[00:02:27] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, we're going to concentrate on Europe and, you know, not buy  from you anymore.
[00:02:33] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't know.
[00:02:33] sindbad ambushed.tv: What do you think?
[00:02:34] Alice Carreto: I think that there are definitely people that are increasingly like rejecting more American products and everything that comes from like the whole consumerism.
[00:02:47] Alice Carreto: But then at the same time, there's also a big element of a lot of people don't.
[00:02:52] Alice Carreto: Like, mean, I'm going to be potentially like an enemy of Europe, like they're going for if of a be
[00:03:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: I mean, this is crazy.
[00:03:01] Alice Carreto: Did you see that?
[00:03:03] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, literally, they're gonna...
[00:03:04] sindbad ambushed.tv: We're sending troops to Greenland to protect Greenland.
[00:03:08] Alice Carreto: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:09] Alice Carreto: No, it's insane.
[00:03:10] Alice Carreto: What do you mean, we?
[00:03:12] sindbad ambushed.tv: Well, I say we, France.
[00:03:15] sindbad ambushed.tv: And not just France, like there's three, obviously, Denmark, I mean, they're the first concerned, and another, yeah.
[00:03:22] sindbad ambushed.tv: But anyway, it's a big...
[00:03:24] sindbad ambushed.tv: But yeah, I'm curious.
[00:03:25] sindbad ambushed.tv: I think it might affect the whole, you know, world.
[00:03:30] sindbad ambushed.tv: The that people can...
[00:03:31] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't know, maybe not, but...
[00:03:32] Alice Carreto: I think it will apportion.
[00:03:35] Alice Carreto: I do think also, unfortunately, there's a big chunk of people that are just gonna keep living how they're living and doing what they're doing.
[00:03:45] Alice Carreto: Maybe not questioning it, but hopefully more and more people will start really questioning and start, you know, planting their ground.
[00:03:56] sindbad ambushed.tv: Because this way, you're Canadian, right?
[00:03:58] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, I'm in Canada.
[00:03:59] sindbad ambushed.tv: I'm
[00:04:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: I mean, it's also a big, like, it's also kind of nuts, right?
[00:04:03] sindbad ambushed.tv: The relationship between Canada and America is, I mean, in the U.S.
[00:04:06] sindbad ambushed.tv: is, hi, Leonor.
[00:04:08] Sway Clarke: Hi, Leonor.
[00:04:10] Leonor Zuzarte: Hey, everyone.
[00:04:11] Leonor Zuzarte: Nice to meet you, Sway.
[00:04:12] Leonor Zuzarte: Nice to meet you.
[00:04:13] Leonor Zuzarte: Nice to meet you.
[00:04:15] Sway Clarke: So, yeah, I was just waiting it out.
[00:04:17] Sway Clarke: They're trying to wait for the orange man to leave the building.
[00:04:21] Sway Clarke: Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:22] sindbad ambushed.tv: But the thing is, who's going to come next?
[00:04:24] sindbad ambushed.tv: trying to wait or are we trying to see if he kicks the bucket beforehand?
[00:04:28] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: That would be, you know, take a while.
[00:04:31] Sway Clarke: It's such a crazy time.
[00:04:32] Sway Clarke: You just I just you just never really know what he's going to do.
[00:04:36] Sway Clarke: And it really depends on how crazy he gets and what he really does.
[00:04:40] Sway Clarke: I mean, the Venezuela thing, the Greenland thing, it's all of this this oil play and, you know, oil is getting low for everybody.
[00:04:48] Sway Clarke: So I don't know if people are going to sit back like they used to.
[00:04:51] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:04:52] Sway Clarke: I mean, if Denmark saying we're standing up and sending troops, then I think Germany will probably send troops shortly.
[00:04:57] Sway Clarke: You know what I mean?
[00:04:58] Sway Clarke: It's who knows?
[00:04:59] Sway Clarke: I.
[00:05:00] Sway Clarke: I don't know.
[00:05:01] Sway Clarke: But I think, Alice, to your point, I think a lot of people, I find a lot of people, they're so overwhelmed with all of this stuff that's happening that they're just like, I don't care.
[00:05:11] Sway Clarke: Like, I just can't about this.
[00:05:13] Sway Clarke: I just got to get to the supermarket.
[00:05:15] Sway Clarke: Can I afford the meat or the bread?
[00:05:18] Alice Carreto: I got to, you know, feed my kids.
[00:05:20] Sway Clarke: And I can't think about much more than that.
[00:05:23] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:05:23] Sway Clarke: And it's a shame.
[00:05:24] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:05:24] Sway Clarke: But I think it's also by design, but I don't know if we want to get into all of that.
[00:05:30] Alice Carreto: I completely agree.
[00:05:32] Alice Carreto: I completely agree.
[00:05:33] Sway Clarke: Keep people on road, they won't go out.
[00:05:36] Sway Clarke: You know, I think that's kind of strange, but the last thing I just want to say, sorry, you said Portugal.
[00:05:43] Sway Clarke: Yeah.
[00:05:44] Sway Clarke: We're both living in Portugal.
[00:05:45] sindbad ambushed.tv: had to sway your- The three of us.
[00:05:47] sindbad ambushed.tv: Portugal, forgot.
[00:05:48] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, I'm moving to Portugal next year.
[00:05:50] Sway Clarke: Wait, you're in- Oh, you're moving here.
[00:05:52] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I'm moving to Portugal next year.
[00:05:54] Sway Clarke: I'm in Germany right now.
[00:05:56] Sway Clarke: Yes.
[00:05:57] Alice Carreto: Yeah.
[00:05:58] Alice Carreto: Whereabouts in Portugal?
[00:05:59] Alice Carreto: Will you be moving?
[00:06:00] Sway Clarke: Well, I think we're going to try and move outside of Lisbon, like not in Lisbon, but just outside, and more because I got two small kids, and there's a lot of schools there, a lot of kind of plug-in communities, but we bought land near Al Jazeera.
[00:06:20] Alice Carreto: Oh, no, this is beautiful.
[00:06:23] Alice Carreto: We're in the south next to where it turns into.
[00:06:29] Alice Carreto: Where are you currently?
[00:06:31] Alice Carreto: So I'm currently in Stubal.
[00:06:34] Alice Carreto: It's a little fisherman town just 30 minutes off of Lisbon.
[00:06:39] Alice Carreto: So that's where I'm from.
[00:06:40] Alice Carreto: But we usually, I live in Lisbon, so most of the time.
[00:06:44] Alice Carreto: But I'm here visiting family.
[00:06:46] Alice Carreto: Ah, and Madalena, you're from?
[00:06:48] Sway Clarke: Where are you?
[00:06:49] Sway Clarke: Same place?
[00:06:52] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I'm from Lisbon, but I'm from like outside of Lisbon.
[00:06:56] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So if I'm telling another Portuguese person I'm from Lisbon.
[00:06:59] Sway Clarke: Lisbon.
[00:06:59] Sway Clarke: I'm Thank
[00:07:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: If I'm telling another Lisbon person, I'm from Guaides, which is like halfway between like Lisbon city center and Cuscais, which is like a little corner.
[00:07:08] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: But yeah, I live right in the center now.
[00:07:12] Leonor Zuzarte: Very lucky.
[00:07:13] Leonor Zuzarte: You'll find that if you tell Portuguese people that you're moving to Al Jazeera and that you think it's close to Lisbon, most Portuguese people would like strongly disagree.
[00:07:26] Leonor Zuzarte: But that's because no, no, no, no.
[00:07:29] Leonor Zuzarte: Just so that you don't get surprised.
[00:07:31] Leonor Zuzarte: We don't have we're a tiny country and we don't have the same geographical sense that other countries do to us.
[00:07:40] Leonor Zuzarte: If it takes you like an hour by car, it's like an hour and a half.
[00:07:45] Leonor Zuzarte: It's already like way outside.
[00:07:47] Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, you could feel like way outside.
[00:07:49] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: couldn't stay close to Lisbon and Al Jazeera definitely doesn't count.
[00:07:53] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: A year and a half ago.
[00:07:55] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And I was like the European mind could absolutely not comprehend like.
[00:07:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I like I actually
[00:08:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I for four hours in one day.
[00:08:05] Sway Clarke: That's far.
[00:08:06] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: That's very, very far.
[00:08:07] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I think it also has do with other gaffes and expenses.
[00:08:11] Sway Clarke: I toured Canada at one point and that's like a four-day drive.
[00:08:16] Sway Clarke: So I can get 16 hours and nothing.
[00:08:21] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: A four-day drive would get me probably further than Russia.
[00:08:26] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I was looking at driving from here to Milan the other day and that's 21 hours.
[00:08:29] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: It would be pretty far.
[00:08:30] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:31] sindbad ambushed.tv: really, it's, it's, it's, it's, drives the whole of Portugal.
[00:08:34] sindbad ambushed.tv: I have family, I have like my stepmother's sister lives in Kelowna.
[00:08:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: Do you know that place, Kelowna?
[00:08:40] sindbad ambushed.tv: In, in in, um, like in Germany?
[00:08:44] Sway Clarke: Germany?
[00:08:46] sindbad ambushed.tv: No, in, in, in, in Canada.
[00:08:48] sindbad ambushed.tv: Maybe I'm pronouncing it wrong, but it's, it's part of, um, you know, British Columbia.
[00:08:53] Sway Clarke: Wow, Kelowna.
[00:08:55] Sway Clarke: Kelowna, yeah, exactly.
[00:08:56] Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:56] sindbad ambushed.tv: And, uh, and I thought on the map, it looks so close to Vancouver.
[00:09:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: Because I spent too much in Vancouver, so I thought, oh, it's just going to be very easy to go there, and then it's like seven hours, but you know, you can drink.
[00:09:08] Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:09] Sway Clarke: But yeah, that's it.
[00:09:11] sindbad ambushed.tv: Canada is crazy, but it's beautiful.
[00:09:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: I loved Vancouver.
[00:09:15] sindbad ambushed.tv: You're from Toronto, right?
[00:09:16] sindbad ambushed.tv: I'm from Toronto, from Toronto.
[00:09:18] Sway Clarke: Vancouver is a different world.
[00:09:20] Sway Clarke: Have been to Vancouver?
[00:09:20] Sway Clarke: Vancouver.
[00:09:21] Sway Clarke: If you like the outdoor, I really loved going snowboarding there and all that kind of stuff, and really, really nice.
[00:09:27] Sway Clarke: But I don't think I would live in, anyways, we could talk for hours.
[00:09:33] Sway Clarke: Anyway, so let's do it.
[00:09:35] Sway Clarke: Okay, so, I just wanted to...
[00:09:37] sindbad ambushed.tv: And then she brought in her two amazing friends, who are also incredible professionals, and we, yeah, and they're an amazing team.
[00:09:48] Sway Clarke: Yeah, thank you.
[00:09:51] Sway Clarke: Okay, so this is everybody?
[00:09:53] Sway Clarke: Yeah, that's it.
[00:09:54] Sway Clarke: Awesome, awesome, awesome.
[00:09:56] Sway Clarke: Well, yeah, to give you a bit of background about myself, my name is...
[00:10:00] Sway Clarke: I'm from Canada, live in Berlin at the moment, and I've been a musician for many years, but actually before that I started coding, was doing IT, and that was my first degree, and gave that degree to my parents and said, I want to go be a musician, became a musician, did the whole thing, and then I kind of got back into coding and AI about five or six years ago and started a company to basically help small businesses make their systems more efficient, and so that could be anything from looking at the protocols, looking at the actual implementation, and then obviously looking at how do you automate things, make things faster, make things more efficient, and essentially taking tax away from people that they don't want to do anymore, and so that's one thing I'd love to really preface the call, is like nobody's job's in danger, we're not here to like take anything away from anybody, that's not the case at all.
[00:10:59] Sway Clarke: now, now.
[00:11:00] Sway Clarke: we're trying to do is find out where bottlenecks are, where inefficiencies are, where are things that you're like, I spend so much  time on this, and it's a waste of time.
[00:11:12] Sway Clarke: I'd rather be doing this, you know?
[00:11:14] Sway Clarke: And we kind of got into it because we were talking, I was talking to Sinbad about his part of the administrative process, and especially with like payments and things like this.
[00:11:29] Sway Clarke: And he also explained to me some of his inefficiencies or where he's spending most of his time, and my next natural question was, well, what does the whole process look like, right?
[00:11:39] Sway Clarke: Like who else is involved and what is everybody doing, right?
[00:11:43] Sway Clarke: So another thing I'd like to say is just, I don't know, I've said this to Sinbad before, but there's a process called lean, like lean management or lean systems.
[00:11:54] Sway Clarke: I don't know if any of you have heard of these, these kind of, this kind of- I've heard it, but only in a very like-
[00:12:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: Critical way because like they, you know, they were saying in France, for example, that like the post office is using the lean management and it was, it was always presented as something really bad, like, you know, where they were cutting jobs and like, yeah.
[00:12:13] Sway Clarke: Well, it's one of those things where, you know, you could say that any system is bad depending on how it's implemented, right?
[00:12:19] Sway Clarke: And so I think lean systems have never been really implemented well.
[00:12:22] Sway Clarke: What they are, the really good points about them is that one, they look at problems.
[00:12:27] Sway Clarke: The whole, the whole process of it is to look at a system, look at its problems in order to make the problems more efficient or improve them.
[00:12:35] Sway Clarke: And then you continue to look at, look at another problem and you make that problem better.
[00:12:39] Sway Clarke: And the idea is that you one day get to a point where there are no more problems, which is impossible, but you try to get as close to that as possible, right?
[00:12:47] Sway Clarke: And the other part is from management or from the whole team, everybody is on the same level looking at the problem from the same directive.
[00:12:55] Sway Clarke: It's not, you know, we're not here looking at what you're doing and why you're doing it this.
[00:13:01] Sway Clarke: It's really just, if there's an administrative system here, how does it work, where are the problems, and how can we fix them so that everybody feels a bit better about the system and things move a little bit quicker?
[00:13:15] Sway Clarke: So I would love to start by just kind of understanding, the three of you likely have different roles, or are you doing the same roles?
[00:13:25] Sway Clarke: Just a quick introduction of, like, what your roles are, and then I would love to get some information about how the system works from your perspectives.
[00:13:36] Sway Clarke: And I'm sorry, I have notes here, so I'll just be writing.
[00:13:39] Sway Clarke: I don't know if that's where we need to ask questions.
[00:13:42] Sway Clarke: We're all very analog right now.
[00:13:45] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I think I'll just maybe explain kind of how this happened.
[00:13:50] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Like, I was doing photography at the time, and I spoke to Sindhat and Pierre about being a visual researcher, and then they wanted me to interview for art director, and then they found a problem.
[00:14:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Supercompetent art director with the relevant experience, and they're like, but we do need someone to do booking, and so I, oop, Sinbad was here.
[00:14:08] Sway Clarke: I don't need to be here, I'm gone.
[00:14:11] Sway Clarke: Sinbad knows, he'll be back in five minutes.
[00:14:14] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So, they sort of hired me, and one of the first things I did with Sinbad was, like, we redid, like, the team directory, so he could tell me every, this was three, three and a half years ago.
[00:14:24] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Everyone who worked with us, so all the, Sinbad's giving you kind of the rundown of the company, right?
[00:14:30] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah.
[00:14:30] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And, like, how it works?
[00:14:31] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah.
[00:14:32] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay, so I was like, let me get to know who, um, these visual researchers and graphic designers and writers are and sort of what they do.
[00:14:41] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And so then I'd get emails in from the clients, and we have this, um, I also kind of wish he was here because I want to screen share.
[00:14:52] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Did you, like, sign some sort of thing that means that I can share everything?
[00:14:56] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: You're muted.
[00:14:58] Sway Clarke: Sorry.
[00:14:58] Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.
[00:14:59] Sway Clarke: You should be here.
[00:15:00] Sway Clarke: Do you see a button in the middle that says share screen?
[00:15:03] Sway Clarke: no, no.
[00:15:03] Sway Clarke: Sorry.
[00:15:04] Sway Clarke: I know how.
[00:15:04] Sway Clarke: I just mean, like, am I allowed to?
[00:15:07] Sway Clarke: Ah, you don't.
[00:15:08] Sway Clarke: If we're talking about anything about banking, that's the only thing we discussed we're not talking about, like, showing me banking documents.
[00:15:16] Sway Clarke: Banking?
[00:15:17] Sway Clarke: No.
[00:15:19] Sway Clarke: Financial, like, the dashboard and stuff.
[00:15:22] Sway Clarke: He showed me the dashboard already, the Google dashboard.
[00:15:24] Sway Clarke: Okay, I'm just gonna, oop.
[00:15:27] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Uh, yeah, I'll turn, I guess I'll turn off my camera because that'll make it easier.
[00:15:31] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Um, I will, okay, I think I might make, ah, it's just so much stuff.
[00:15:38] Sway Clarke: No worries.
[00:15:39] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Uh, automatic picture setting.
[00:15:41] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:15:42] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So the first place I started was here.
[00:15:46] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And this is sort of how we plan our, and so also everything, everything was, like, very bare bones.
[00:15:53] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And, like, I've, we've come up with, like, kind of a color coding system, but, like, the first thing I learned to do was, like, soon, here.
[00:15:58] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: a let's a And So look
[00:16:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I get an email from a client.
[00:16:02] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I go in our little calendar and I sort of like set up like a, let me see.
[00:16:09] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I have, I have like a little key here.
[00:16:12] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Like if they want to start tomorrow, that would be Thursday.
[00:16:20] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I would do this.
[00:16:22] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then I would go in a little availability and I'd figure out who is free and who isn't.
[00:16:25] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: By the way, all of this is like super public.
[00:16:29] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So like if I'm in here, like people can see what I'm doing and all of the freelancers have access to each other's availability.
[00:16:35] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Like we aim to be very transparent because we think it's correct, but also it's because we're kind of just working off of Google Sheets.
[00:16:43] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then, for example, the rest of the team also knows who is on duty on management because it's useful.
[00:16:51] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So this is basically the booking and the scheduling for projects.
[00:16:56] Alice Carreto: Yes.
[00:16:57] Alice Carreto: Yeah.
[00:16:57] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Everything happens on Google Sheets.
[00:16:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:17:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And so, yeah, so I take the availability, I write down who's going in, and then we have, for example, if I'm still in the process of booking, we have a team directory.
[00:17:12] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: There's a few things with the team directory that could also be optimized quite a bit.
[00:17:20] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: One thing that comes to mind is that, like, the rate has to be manually input in, like, several places.
[00:17:28] Sway Clarke: Interesting.
[00:17:28] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And so, sometimes, sometimes it's not, like, so, we've only recently as well started, like, keeping score of, like, when it is we raise people.
[00:17:39] Sway Clarke: So, just so I jump in, this is the team directory in terms of all your freelancers?
[00:17:43] Sway Clarke: In terms of all of our freelancers, yes.
[00:17:45] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So, we have, like, their names, their language, their department, email number, location for, for them, for their time zone, it's important.
[00:17:57] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:17:58] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then their rates, and then their.
[00:18:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Portfolio hyperlink, and then their timesheets, and then the log of how much, like, when they were raised, and just some little notes.
[00:18:11] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Basically, one thing that kind of gets us sometimes is that, like, the rate here is also used on the dashboard, and the dashboard is where we put in, like, our projects.
[00:18:29] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then we put in the people's names and the hours, and it should automatically pull the rate.
[00:18:39] Sway Clarke: The rate.
[00:18:40] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And only this year or, yeah, only November 24 did we start implementing this thing where, like, the rate used to be the situation where, like, if Pablo was making, you know, Pablo's been with the company for since the beginning.
[00:18:54] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So Pablo would probably start at 15, and he's now at 22.
[00:18:58] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And the problem we had previously.
[00:18:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: course.
[00:19:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: was that like anytime I raised Pablo the numbers on the previous months would also increase and so like the margins like five years later the margin that was like in a in a perfectly good like target place was now super low because the numbers kept changing okay it wasn't an isolated change is what you're saying yeah yeah exactly so like if I you know if I change this number here ideally I would only want it to change here once it's like at the same time it was changed but it was also changing it in months super previous so the problem with this is that we have to every month we have to like copy this into another column and make sure all the numbers are right and then they also have to match up here and you know is there a third place that this number is usually inconsistent with yeah no it's usually that's it it's
[00:20:01] Leonor Zuzarte: FCA, team directory, persons, timesheet.
[00:20:06] Leonor Zuzarte: yeah, that's another one.
[00:20:08] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: People's timesheets would be the best thing to automate, but we can barely even get people to use the correct timesheets.
[00:20:14] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And sometimes we've had silly situations where there was one time we raised this girl and we forgot to tell her.
[00:20:24] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And so three months later we were like, hey, we actually have like another Euro 50 per hour you've worked for the last two months.
[00:20:32] Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, sometimes people...
[00:20:34] Leonor Zuzarte: people...
[00:20:35] Leonor Zuzarte: But now, like the upside is that now I exist.
[00:20:40] Leonor Zuzarte: So for the people that that happened to, I was just like straight up there with them like, oh, actually we want to raise you to 17 from the beginning of the month.
[00:20:49] Leonor Zuzarte: I've gone to your past projects, this is what's missing, just invoice for it.
[00:20:53] Leonor Zuzarte: Oh yeah, sorry, I was trying to explain our roles.
[00:20:55] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I meant to, I meant to say that like I was hired and I was doing just this booking stuff.
[00:21:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And I was filling in the dashboard, and a few months later, I was like, hey, I'm working very long hours, and the admin is getting a little bit difficult.
[00:21:12] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:21:13] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Would we be keen to bring in another person?
[00:21:16] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So I brought in Leonor as like an admin assist capacity.
[00:21:20] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: She was working about 15 hours a week on just his admin stuff.
[00:21:25] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:21:25] Leonor Zuzarte: Actually, it was invoicing at the time.
[00:21:29] Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
[00:21:30] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah, because basically when I brought in Leonor to help me, they were then like, now you also send invoices.
[00:21:36] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:21:37] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So Leonor directly sort of went to like dashboarding and invoicing, and then she started helping me more.
[00:21:44] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then there were, for that first year, we were both working and we were covering each other.
[00:21:50] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So somehow we managed to take like a month off each, but we also had to like work an extra month for the other person to be on holiday.
[00:21:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: just because we, redoing So
[00:22:01] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: We each had like 13 months that year.
[00:22:04] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Then we hired Elise to help.
[00:22:08] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And Elise is great and wonderful and very competent.
[00:22:10] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And now her and I share the booking job.
[00:22:16] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: She takes care of most of the invoicing and the chasing up people for overdue invoices.
[00:22:25] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And I try and sort of like coordinate the other like problems who need to fall into someone's laps of their mind.
[00:22:32] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:22:33] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And one of like, one of the really big chunks of those problems was like, once we hired people, they didn't have much support and they were just kind of floating around and, you know, come on.
[00:22:50] Leonor Zuzarte: For my, for me?
[00:22:51] Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:52] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: She basically, like we invented an HR position, community manager thing and Leonor is doing a wonderful job.
[00:22:58] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Thank you.
[00:22:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: care of the freelance.
[00:23:00] Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, so that was essentially because me, Madalena, and Elise were all rotating the same kind of tasks, if you will, which made some sense because Elise was part-timing on a very flexible support schedule.
[00:23:19] Leonor Zuzarte: And working with Bold Move.
[00:23:22] Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, and our projects had like grown exponentially, so the system was kind of like, it was not adapting, so we were trying to adapt to it.
[00:23:31] Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah.
[00:23:32] Leonor Zuzarte: Which was not being the best, I don't think.
[00:23:36] Leonor Zuzarte: But anyways, we figured out that one thing that we could not really answer to consistently, and in a way that made us proud, were freelancer problems.
[00:23:48] Leonor Zuzarte: Because imagine, you're taking care of all this, and you're handling all of the bookings, and all of the people that want to do a project, but maybe they no longer want those dates, but maybe they want other dates.
[00:23:59] Leonor Zuzarte: much.
[00:23:59] Leonor Zuzarte: And that's
[00:24:01] Leonor Zuzarte: And someone's messaging you like, oh, I think I made a mistake in my invoice.
[00:24:06] Leonor Zuzarte: How can I correct it?
[00:24:07] Leonor Zuzarte: Oh, hey, sorry.
[00:24:08] Leonor Zuzarte: I haven't really had a project in two weeks.
[00:24:11] Leonor Zuzarte: Is everything okay?
[00:24:12] Leonor Zuzarte: Oh, hi.
[00:24:13] Leonor Zuzarte: I would really like to go on vacation for three months.
[00:24:16] Leonor Zuzarte: Is that okay by you guys?
[00:24:17] Leonor Zuzarte: Or should I just like kind of, you know?
[00:24:19] Leonor Zuzarte: And you're already trapped in this other kind of like cyclone of information and we weren't really being the most efficient at coordinating with our team.
[00:24:30] Leonor Zuzarte: So that's kind of what I'm, what I, what became my job.
[00:24:35] Leonor Zuzarte: So almost like the freelance management in a way.
[00:24:39] Leonor Zuzarte: If you will, or like the, the bridge between, you know, freelancers and core full-time team.
[00:24:47] Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
[00:24:49] Leonor Zuzarte: And Alice, did you want to say something?
[00:24:51] Sway Clarke: Yes.
[00:24:52] Alice Carreto: I mean, I was just mostly going to sum up also what Madalena said, but in respect to my role, um, what, what, sorry, I was going to just.
[00:25:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: Very, very briefly, in case Leonor didn't say, like the other big job of Leonor is like when there's a new person writing who wants a job, like she's going to basically respond to that person, like assess, like send them an assessment and then basically do the onboarding as well.
[00:25:15] sindbad ambushed.tv: So I don't know if she mentioned that, but we also another another problem at the time with that was that Pierre was doing the hiring.
[00:25:26] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: But between hiring and becoming like fully fledged team members who could take on projects on their own, there's like a huge sort of like learning curve.
[00:25:36] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And people really didn't have like anyone to hold their hands through it.
[00:25:39] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: so we would like hire people, spend resources on training them, but like they would lose momentum because nobody was like nobody was checking in with them.
[00:25:47] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I, you know, if I'm booking eight projects in one day and I have like six producers like calling me incessantly and I never really speak to one of these newbies like I'm not going.
[00:26:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: to then have the the bandwidth to like whatsapp them and be like hi this is from Ambushed how are you we have this project and you know I'm just trying to like book the bare minimum of the team and it's also unfortunately the projects come really fast so for me to like have to reach out to someone I've never spoken to and be like are you available today and tomorrow felt kind of wrong and so Leonor is like that that continuity like she's like the only thing she doesn't do I believe is like assess the the assessments they get and like make the final call but she was like Pierre the other co-founders right hand for that and she takes care of everything before and after and she'll like be looking at the calendar and she'll call me or Elise and be like hi I see you're booking this can I get a parallel designer to make a proposal or do you want to squeeze in Louise for these days or whatever and we're like yes thank you very useful.
[00:26:55] Sway Clarke: Okay.
[00:26:57] Sway Clarke: Alice go ahead.
[00:26:57] Sway Clarke: Quickly just Poop
[00:27:00] Alice Carreto: My role, I help Madalena with bookings.
[00:27:03] Alice Carreto: So two days a week, Mondays and Fridays, I am manning the email, responding to the hello, putting teams together.
[00:27:12] Alice Carreto: I usually also find some time during that, depending on the volumes, depending on how crazy it is, to also be filling in the dashboard.
[00:27:21] Alice Carreto: The one that you saw on the dashboard is putting people's hours in, putting the projects in, putting the rates, the initial agreed rates, and then also understanding, trying to understand, did we honor the initial agreement?
[00:27:36] Alice Carreto: Have we gone over?
[00:27:38] Alice Carreto: Did we work more additional days for revisions?
[00:27:42] Alice Carreto: And so trying to like put everything on the dashboard to, so that we can actually visualize it and see where the margin's at, to then get back to the clients with either like, hey, everything went according to schedule, we're going to close it.
[00:28:00] Alice Carreto: Project and invoice it or like here, here's the how, here's the additional days that we worked and that you requested or here's the reasons why.
[00:28:08] Alice Carreto: So there's like the bookings that go very hand in hand with this dashboard.
[00:28:13] Alice Carreto: And then there's the two other things that I picked up once new node transitioned to this HR community manager, freelancer, management freelancer, which was the invoicing.
[00:28:31] Alice Carreto: then I also carry the project to the end and I invoice these projects.
[00:28:36] Alice Carreto: The invoicing comes with its added fun little task of running after late payments.
[00:28:45] Alice Carreto: So we have a 30 day payment term, but a lot of these people go over and we have a software for it, which is servant, which is very helpful.
[00:28:58] Alice Carreto: Absolutely.
[00:29:00] Alice Carreto: Yeah, if you want to show it, I mean, I don't know if it's...
[00:29:04] sindbad ambushed.tv: I can do that.
[00:29:06] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then another problem with this is that people don't pay, and then after people don't pay, we're supposed to, we're supposed to, it sounds bad that I'm saying we're supposed to, we should be immediately, like, threatening them with the overtime.
[00:29:24] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Simbad, can I, like, pop open any random invoice?
[00:29:27] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah, yeah, no problem.
[00:29:30] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay, basically, so yeah, this is, this is a problem right now.
[00:29:37] sindbad ambushed.tv: These are outstanding invoices.
[00:29:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, and all the red ones are late payments.
[00:29:45] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: But these ones over here are usually not too, too bad.
[00:29:50] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: For example, we figured out that a third of this is one specific company that Sindbad spoke to yesterday.
[00:29:56] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: They're really nice.
[00:29:57] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: They've been working with us a lot recently.
[00:29:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: you should be
[00:30:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: It's just, they're like, oh, our clients pay us in 110 days, and we're like, not our problem, kindly pay us.
[00:30:07] Sway Clarke: Yeah, for sure.
[00:30:08] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I've actually also just gotten another request from another guy who wants a project, and he...
[00:30:13] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Sugar high.
[00:30:15] Alice Carreto: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:16] Sway Clarke: So just so I understand, you've got, you're balancing two sides of clients, essentially, because you're having clients that are paying you, which are coming in and saying, I want this thing done, and then you have freelancers that are doing work.
[00:30:29] Sway Clarke: Do I understand that?
[00:30:30] Sway Clarke: And then you're managing these both, and so you have to pay freelancers, but they have to pay you?
[00:30:36] Sway Clarke: Yes.
[00:30:37] Alice Carreto: Yeah, but in terms of paying our freelancers, don't, that is, Sinbad takes care completely of that task.
[00:30:45] Alice Carreto: We don't have to, we don't really have to worry about that added task.
[00:30:52] Sway Clarke: So let me, can you just run me through the flow of a prop, like a project?
[00:31:00] Sway Clarke: That happens and like how it comes in exactly, how it's done, who are the two, you know, the two parties involved, and how then the payment get, how the payments happen and then how you close it.
[00:31:14] Sway Clarke: I would love to just.
[00:31:15] Sway Clarke: Okay, cool.
[00:31:15] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I'll run you beginning to end.
[00:31:18] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: End with dates.
[00:31:19] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And there is sort of like a bottleneck and a big part that gets slowed down and that's annoying.
[00:31:25] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So on Friday the 5th, I received this email.
[00:31:28] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Wait, I need to move this screen.
[00:31:32] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay, can you still see everything?
[00:31:33] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah.
[00:31:34] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay, Friday the 5th, Tom comes in and he goes, hello, we would like you to work on this project.
[00:31:39] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Here is everything.
[00:31:40] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And Elise replied, yes, great, we're available.
[00:31:48] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And okay, so from 5 to.
[00:31:55] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: 5.
[00:31:56] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay, so it was booked.
[00:31:58] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay, so project comes in.
[00:31:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: going to be?
[00:31:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:31:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: then, .
[00:31:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Thank
[00:32:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Tom gives us the details, Elise goes in the calendar, writes up the project, adds in the people, and then we have to go to each individual person.
[00:32:12] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Wait, I'm gonna add the Discord as well.
[00:32:20] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Entire screen, okay.
[00:32:24] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So the project comes in?
[00:32:26] Alice Carreto: Yeah, desculpa.
[00:32:28] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So the project comes in, we write it up in our little calendar.
[00:32:34] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: We figure out who it is that might be available.
[00:32:38] Sway Clarke: So now you're matching.
[00:32:39] Sway Clarke: Project comes in, now you gotta go find a freelancer to match that project.
[00:32:44] Sway Clarke: Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:45] Sway Clarke: A little Tetris.
[00:32:46] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's a team, so basically, sorry, just to give you the overall, the way it works is we work seven days a week.
[00:32:53] sindbad ambushed.tv: We have a, um, an art director who oversees projects for four days straight.
[00:33:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: The long days, then that person rests for four days, while another art director oversees, so as you can see here, A.D.
[00:33:08] sindbad ambushed.tv: Zoe, A.D.
[00:33:09] sindbad ambushed.tv: James.
[00:33:10] sindbad ambushed.tv: So they do four days on, four days off.
[00:33:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's very intense, so that's why we implemented this system.
[00:33:17] sindbad ambushed.tv: And so, and their team, so it's not just one freelancer for a project.
[00:33:23] sindbad ambushed.tv: We put together a team of a visual researcher and a designer, and sometimes even a writer.
[00:33:28] sindbad ambushed.tv: By the way, I've got news on this.
[00:33:30] sindbad ambushed.tv: We can discuss this later, Madalena, Alice, and Leonor, like I've got an idea about trying to push the writing.
[00:33:36] sindbad ambushed.tv: spoke to Oliver, but yeah, so, sorry, that's, I just wanted you to, and we're trying to, best possible team to the project, knowing the strength and, you know, a team is like, could be Zoe and some freelancers, could be Jane.
[00:33:52] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yes, so, a team is, exactly, a team is, actually, Zoe and James, it's.
[00:34:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Kind of like, well, get the request and we'll come in here.
[00:34:03] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So, you and James are always happening, and then recently, for example, today is Thursday.
[00:34:09] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So there are one, two, three, four, five, six, six projects in this, like, easy thing going on, and I did have these that were, like, pending booking, but didn't quite happen yet.
[00:34:27] Alice Carreto: Okay.
[00:34:28] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I should nudge this today.
[00:34:32] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay, so the project comes in, depending on who the client is, it can be very easy to book or very difficult.
[00:34:41] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So we have this, you know, regular clients who are like, oh, hi, we want to book Wednesday to Friday, and we want Joelle.
[00:34:50] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And I'm like, Joelle's unavailable.
[00:34:51] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Can it be these guys?
[00:34:52] sindbad ambushed.tv: And they're like, absolutely, go for it.
[00:34:53] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:34:54] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Other times, there's a lot of back and forward, and I have to come up on the team directory and, like...
[00:35:01] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Present a bunch of portfolios, like send them hyperlinks to get to these so that they can like approve each individual team member.
[00:35:09] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Portfolios are another bottleneck.
[00:35:11] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: We don't have enough.
[00:35:12] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: We haven't finished.
[00:35:15] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: For the more recent hires in the last six months.
[00:35:19] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah, maybe somebody put a pin in this and we can get back to this later because I think we can do something with the project directory.
[00:35:25] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I'm just kind of curious.
[00:35:28] Sway Clarke: You have to do all this matching, right?
[00:35:31] Sway Clarke: Yes.
[00:35:32] Sway Clarke: But you have a database of freelancers and then you have their availability.
[00:35:36] Sway Clarke: And you're doing the matching manually.
[00:35:38] Sway Clarke: Yes.
[00:35:40] Sway Clarke: There's not an option for the client to do the matching themselves where they just said...
[00:35:44] Sway Clarke: No, and we don't want that.
[00:35:46] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: We don't want that for several reasons.
[00:35:48] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: First of all, they have no idea what they're doing.
[00:35:50] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Second of all, we don't have enough time to update the portfolios constantly for them to have a correct overview of how the people are doing.
[00:35:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: right.
[00:35:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: can be left are The think Oh You we're
[00:36:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then, for example, there's loads of, like, little personal, like, we have this designer and this researcher who don't work very well together, we have this designer who refuses to work for this director, or we have, you know, we occasionally even get, people will be like, oh, I want designer A, and I'm like, I don't want to say out loud, but I'm like, designer B, who I'm recommending, has been with AMBUSHED for six years, and they're much better.
[00:36:25] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah, yeah, I get what you're know that you're an impossible person, so please don't do this to us.
[00:36:30] Sway Clarke: And sorry.
[00:36:31] Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, we really don't want to get clients attached, because also, for instance, like, Zoe, who's one of our wonderful, amazing art directors now, used to be a designer with us.
[00:36:42] Leonor Zuzarte: She was an amazing designer.
[00:36:45] Leonor Zuzarte: The problem is that when clients get attached to, like, particular team members, then that creates, like, big problems in booking projects, because we can't guarantee freelancer availability.
[00:36:57] Leonor Zuzarte: If everyone wants Zoe, then, you
[00:37:00] Leonor Zuzarte: You know, out of four projects, we're booking one.
[00:37:02] Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, makes sense.
[00:37:04] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah, we also, because we work in large teams, we're sort of trying to promote this thing that, like, you're booking ambushed, and it's a community, and you have, so you have the two art directors, but now we also have two art director's assistants, because it is difficult for an art director to manage, like, 10, 12 projects in a day, and so one of our ID assistants also used to be a visual researcher, and we also still get requests being like, hi, is Gaetano available, and we're like, Gaetano's now an art directing assistant, he'll have a, pardon, sorry, he'll have a hand in this, but he won't actually be doing the, you know, he's not your visual researcher, and so the thing about the teams is that, like, the team is the, you know, the researcher and the designer, and then Zoe and James are, like, overseeing, and Gaetano and Alexi are helping Zoe and James.
[00:37:55] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay, that's very clear for me, okay.
[00:37:59] Sway Clarke: Sometimes.
[00:38:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Due to just the nature of like people pushing and pulling on projects and the timelines getting shifted and availability shifting because everyone's in a freelancer, we do have this sort of like Tetris.
[00:38:12] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So here, for example, we're starting with one researcher and ending with another, which is another thing clients complain about, which is also why we have the art directors to not only to sort of like make sure the quality is consistent, but also to be the point of contact between the director and the.
[00:38:26] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So like I am to the producers what the art directors are to the directors, the film directors.
[00:38:33] Sway Clarke: Makes sense.
[00:38:34] Sway Clarke: And so what part of just very quickly, is there a part of this process because like with the with the matching, is there a part of this that is either annoying or takes a lot of time or, you know, just that you would change in somehow the way it's done.
[00:38:53] sindbad ambushed.tv: Oh, sorry.
[00:38:56] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, I mean, unless you matter now, you know, reply first.
[00:39:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: But if Leonor you have something to say.
[00:39:01] sindbad ambushed.tv: Leonor go for it.
[00:39:03] Leonor Zuzarte: Oh I can't really, so I'm in an interesting position because I've worked bookings and I am now in kind of like not really uncharted territory but a position that was very undefined for a really long time.
[00:39:21] Leonor Zuzarte: And something that I would be really interested in doing but seems like a very overwhelming task right now.
[00:39:30] Leonor Zuzarte: Is to create kind of a like freelancer profile database.
[00:39:36] Leonor Zuzarte: That could like hyperlink to their names in the team directory or whatever.
[00:39:41] Leonor Zuzarte: So that information is accessible because a lot of the times, especially with new people, Madalena and Elise will have to ask me like, oh, are they like good at fashion or do they have any strong interests or disinterests or likes or disinterests.
[00:40:00] Leonor Zuzarte: Like, skills that are a little bit outside of what we do on a daily basis, also live in our brains, like, oh, this person can use Photoshop really well, or this person is really good at, like, after effects.
[00:40:18] Leonor Zuzarte: This is all information that lives in our brains and in the art director's brains, and that me, personally, in my new position, I'm looking, or I'm more brainstorming ways to do that than I am actually doing it, but it is a goal that I would have for this process of, like, team selection is to have that information, like, accessible somewhere.
[00:40:47] Leonor Zuzarte: And, and why, why are you thinking about that?
[00:40:50] Sway Clarke: Why is this, why would this be important to build, or why would you want that?
[00:40:54] Leonor Zuzarte: Because, uh, because sometimes there are, like, slight...
[00:41:00] Leonor Zuzarte: Creative cues in projects that art directors look at and are like, oh, it would be really cool if we could get someone that could do like a cover on After Effects or, you know, um, yeah, essentially, I just want to improve the matching of the project to the person.
[00:41:22] Leonor Zuzarte: Does that make sense?
[00:41:23] Sway Clarke: Okay, so that's what I wanted to, I was, I was wondering if you had that, what would that do for the team?
[00:41:28] Sway Clarke: What would that do for the process, right?
[00:41:30] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I unfortunately think that that is the lowest priority because we have, we have two other things.
[00:41:40] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: One is practical and one is kind of shallow.
[00:41:43] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So the practical thing is we need to match timelines to projects.
[00:41:45] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And in this, in this whole sort of matching process, I have ADHD, so I have a great time.
[00:41:52] Alice Carreto: It's like Tetris.
[00:41:53] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I really enjoy it.
[00:41:55] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: My only real sort of problem is when things aren't as I...
[00:42:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So if either a freelancer tells, like, so if I'm booking a project for Monday, and I have one, two, three, four, five, six, I have seven people who are claiming they're available.
[00:42:12] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And so I book five projects, and all of a sudden, four of them are actually like, hey, I lied.
[00:42:18] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Like, that's impossible.
[00:42:20] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: But I don't think there's much I can do about that.
[00:42:23] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then if the producers are like, oh, I know I said I want to do all Monday to Wednesday, but now I want him Tuesday to Saturday, and I have to be like, he's not available Friday or Saturday.
[00:42:34] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And so the availability is being wrong, and the timelines getting shifted is tricky, but I'm not sure there's much we can do about that.
[00:42:42] Sway Clarke: So the availability from the freelancers is incorrect, because they're changing their minds somehow?
[00:42:49] Sway Clarke: Somehow, sometimes they're changing their minds.
[00:42:52] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Often it's, we ask them, you know, they claim to be available Monday to Friday.
[00:43:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And Monday at like 9 p.m., I'm like, can you now work Tuesday to Friday?
[00:43:03] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And they're like, oh, , actually, Wednesday afternoon is out.
[00:43:06] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And or I've just been booked on a shoot because they're freelancers, so they can do whatever they want.
[00:43:12] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Or occasionally the annoying one is like, oh, I just forgot.
[00:43:16] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I'm actually not available at all.
[00:43:18] Sway Clarke: And we always we know who these people are.
[00:43:20] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So usually we count on this.
[00:43:22] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And like if we pencil them in, we've penciled in four people for that one.
[00:43:25] Sway Clarke: But there's no but there's no way right now what's happening is that the communication or the updating, for example, of freelancers and their particular lifestyles and their availability is also not being updated.
[00:43:38] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:43:39] Sway Clarke: Because they may tell you every week I'm available Monday to Thursday or something like this.
[00:43:43] Sway Clarke: But in the middle of the month, they decide that they want to go to Italy or something and do something else.
[00:43:48] Sway Clarke: But they're not able to inform you of that.
[00:43:51] Sway Clarke: So usually when they go to Italy, they're really good about saying they're unavailable.
[00:43:57] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: But for example, well, as well as supposed to be.
[00:44:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I'm today and tomorrow until 5.30 p.m., and I sent him a message at a really reasonable time, and he was like, oh, I guess I'm not, and then this here that was unavailable, he was like, but I am flying back on Monday, so I can be available on Monday from 2.30, and I was like, oh, okay, so.
[00:44:16] Sway Clarke: So is it, sorry, is it that there's no way for them to communicate, that communication is not there, or is it just simply that they're unreliable?
[00:44:25] Sway Clarke: They're unreliable.
[00:44:26] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Some are more unreliable than others.
[00:44:29] Alice Carreto: One thing I can say, sorry about this, sorry.
[00:44:31] sindbad ambushed.tv: First of all, I wanted to say, Leonor, I think it's really interesting that you want to do this, so let's not forget about this.
[00:44:37] sindbad ambushed.tv: I've written it down as well.
[00:44:38] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yes, I can say, because I've worked as a freelancer, I was writing treatments for directors for another company called the Moon Unit, and what they were doing is, and I don't know if this is clever or not, if it would be really a game changer or not, to be honest, but they were, they made you download a very simple app, and every Sunday night, you receive
[00:45:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: the message and you have to confirm your availability for the week.
[00:45:04] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't know if that would be a game changer or not, but it is, that's how they used to do it to, you know, obviously there's still going to be people who forget or whatever, or they say something on Sunday night and then it changes on Monday or Tuesday or whatever, but still maybe that's kind of, it's a prompt to, to, you know, to not forget to do their availability.
[00:45:24] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't know if that's, if people will want to download, like, I mean, yeah, I don't know.
[00:45:30] sindbad ambushed.tv: Does that sound like an interesting option to you guys?
[00:45:34] sindbad ambushed.tv: Now I'm talking to, you know, the, I mean, I've had one of these before for a job as well.
[00:45:42] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I think it's okay.
[00:45:43] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: But honestly, like this part of everything is probably one of the least problematic in our jobs.
[00:45:53] Alice Carreto: One of the least time consuming.
[00:45:55] sindbad ambushed.tv: Okay.
[00:45:55] sindbad ambushed.tv: So let's move on.
[00:45:56] Sway Clarke: So we, we got to the calendar, you put everything in the calendar and then.
[00:46:01] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then we confirm the team, we go on Discord, which is our Slack, we'll make a little group and be like, hey guys, this is an upcoming project, is everyone available?
[00:46:15] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: In the meantime, know, Desiree was actually not available Saturday afternoon, so I bring in Francesco, we put on an assistant, everything's ready.
[00:46:23] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I now have to send out an Ops thread.
[00:46:30] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So I go back to the producer and I'm like, this is, you know, this is confirmed, this is the rate, everything's good.
[00:46:35] Alice Carreto: The producer says, yes, great.
[00:46:38] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And so then we send out this connecting email, which is like, we send this to obviously everyone on the other side, the director and the producers.
[00:46:48] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And we're introducing the team, sharing our schedule for their transparency, you know, call time, whatever.
[00:46:55] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then adding in all of the details that we're
[00:47:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: It's sent to us by the producer for the team so that they also know everything.
[00:47:04] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: They can see that we have everything.
[00:47:06] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay.
[00:47:09] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And so then what happens is the project will go on without us.
[00:47:19] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So at this point, the booking team steps away.
[00:47:27] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And yeah, so at this point, the booking team steps away.
[00:47:29] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And it's now James's job to direct all of us through, you know, the first day where they get batch one in the proposal, version one, final version.
[00:47:39] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then sometimes they come in for like edits and we don't have book teams.
[00:47:42] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And that's a nightmare, too.
[00:47:43] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: But I think that's just part of the job.
[00:47:44] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And then basically, once this ends on December 15th, we were closed from December 20th through January 2nd.
[00:47:57] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So the whole project ended.
[00:47:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: dogs.
[00:47:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: what December 23rd.
[00:48:02] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Okay, halfway during the project, something happened, we needed someone to do it, I, whatever, the project ended, and then Tom, the producer, on the 29th of December, we were closed, was like, hi, can we please have the invoice?
[00:48:21] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And, so that was on the 29th of December, and we only got back to him on the 12th of January, which was like 10 days after we opened, because at this point, we have to go to the dashboard, find the project over here, the project had initially outlined three to five days, this ended up being one, two, three, four, five, six days.
[00:48:50] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: This is the amount that we sort of assumed it was going to be, and then we have to add in everyone's hours, so we manually have to go, and, okay, so Jana worked on this.
[00:49:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: We have to go get an ambush timesheet, find her timesheet, scroll all the way down, hope that she's… We trust people in terms of timesheet, just so you know the system.
[00:49:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: I know there are companies where you clock in and there's this kind of thing, but we decided that actually we just trust what they say, and frankly, I think it's a bit, it's not like Big Brother, like, oh, we're seeing how long, you know.
[00:49:28] sindbad ambushed.tv: We kind of, but if suddenly there's crazy hours, I mean, here it's like 14 hours a day, and it's like, you know, we can't question it, understand why it happened.
[00:49:37] sindbad ambushed.tv: And so, sorry, I'll let you finish after a minute, I just wanted to explain.
[00:49:41] sindbad ambushed.tv: And the reason why I thought, you know, in terms of the payment, what I do later, I know I'm jumping a little bit and then I'll let you finish, but I, when people put that time, I kind of like to, yeah, look at their invoice, look if that is odd, and I kind of…
[00:50:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: I think it's a good idea that it's someone else, because then it's like multiple people looking at the same thing and potentially seeing something that doesn't make quite sense, you know?
[00:50:12] sindbad ambushed.tv: So yeah, sorry.
[00:50:13] Sway Clarke: Or you're doing the background Big Brother stuff, is what you're saying?
[00:50:16] Sway Clarke: No, no, no, no.
[00:50:18] Sway Clarke: There's no Big Brother stuff.
[00:50:19] sindbad ambushed.tv: So if you want to see an invoice, if it's like a crazy amount or whatever, I question invoices and make sure that it fits A, with what's in the dashboard, B, with what's in the timesheet.
[00:50:32] sindbad ambushed.tv: And, you know, for example, the other day, it happened, Alice, remember, with Nisa, that there was a day where she was not working.
[00:50:40] sindbad ambushed.tv: Or she was supposed to work, but in the end, I don't know, I can't remember why, but she basically didn't know her work, but she did charge us a full day.
[00:50:48] sindbad ambushed.tv: So I code that, I mean, we code that with Alice.
[00:50:51] sindbad ambushed.tv: And so this is why, you know, I think it's kind of a good thing that I'm still doing this thing, because at the end of the day, like, it's quite rare, but I do.
[00:51:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: I think it means people know they can't  with us.
[00:51:04] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's a business, right?
[00:51:06] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah.
[00:51:06] sindbad ambushed.tv: You know, it's not Big Brother, we trust them, but when there's something really odd, we kind of normally, I think we catch it.
[00:51:14] sindbad ambushed.tv: Okay.
[00:51:14] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So basically, because we don't automate any sort of control of people's work or screens or anything insane like that, we also don't automate timesheets or payments or anything like that.
[00:51:28] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Everything's done like manually one by one.
[00:51:30] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So at this point, you know, I come in the dashboard.
[00:51:33] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I have everyone's names here.
[00:51:35] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I have to go back to the calendar, possibly even the Discord to make sure everyone's actually on here.
[00:51:41] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Go in here, make sure that the number matches up as per the number that gets input here from their rates.
[00:51:49] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So just so I'm just following it.
[00:51:52] Sway Clarke: So you have that we're looking at this Unibet project, for example.
[00:51:55] Sway Clarke: Yes.
[00:51:55] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: We're looking at the Unibet project.
[00:51:57] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah.
[00:51:58] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah.
[00:51:58] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah, I that's that.
[00:51:59] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah.
[00:52:00] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I go here and so I go, I need to fill in Jana's hours.
[00:52:04] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: And so I come to Jana's timesheet.
[00:52:06] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: First, I cross my fingers and make sure she's, you know, hope she's already filled it in.
[00:52:10] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Then I've asked them not to do this.
[00:52:14] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So, for example, this 1430 should actually be 14.5 hours because I want to be able to really quickly come in here and like, make sure that that number is right.
[00:52:31] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah.
[00:52:32] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Over here.
[00:52:33] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Yeah.
[00:52:34] Sway Clarke: 14 hours are nuts.
[00:52:36] sindbad ambushed.tv: And then, you know, for example, that's crazy.
[00:52:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: Just for example.
[00:52:40] Sway Clarke: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:52:41] Sway Clarke: Just so I understand.
[00:52:42] Sway Clarke: Every freelancer has this timesheet.
[00:52:45] Sway Clarke: Yes.
[00:52:45] Sway Clarke: Every freelancer goes home after they work and they say, I work 12 hours a day.
[00:52:50] Sway Clarke: Yes.
[00:52:52] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: However, not every freelancer has this timesheet, which is the template that we created.
[00:52:57] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Some freelancers might have this timesheet,
[00:53:02] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: So Tamara doesn't put in what hours she was in and what hours she was out.
[00:53:08] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Some freelancers have this timesheet.
[00:53:13] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Wow, okay.
[00:53:14] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Elise, could you take over for a second?
[00:53:16] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: I think my doorbell just rang.
[00:53:17] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: Sorry.
[00:53:18] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: This is a Notion.
[00:53:19] Sway Clarke: There's a Notion timesheet and then there's Google Sheets timesheet.
[00:53:24] Leonor Zuzarte: Essentially, what happens when we onboard is we give them the timesheet template.
[00:53:29] Leonor Zuzarte: I'm so sorry, Elise.
[00:53:30] Leonor Zuzarte: Did I interrupt you?
[00:53:31] Leonor Zuzarte: No, no, but it's relevant to your role too, so that's fine.
[00:53:36] Leonor Zuzarte: No, that's because the policy right now is there are certain key crucial elements that we need to know, which is what project, what day, how many hours.
[00:53:50] Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah.
[00:53:52] Leonor Zuzarte: And so when we onboard a new freelancer, we give them the timesheet template, but we also give them the...
[00:53:59] Leonor Zuzarte: ...
[00:53:59] Leonor Zuzarte: ...
[00:54:00] Leonor Zuzarte: Freedom to kind of like adapt it, however works best for them, as long as the crucial information remains visible, accessible, and easy to understand.
[00:54:13] Leonor Zuzarte: From my perspective, that's also to kind of encourage freelancers to really upkeep their timesheet.
[00:54:20] Leonor Zuzarte: Because some freelancers like to invoice like all the projects that they did only at the end of the month.
[00:54:26] Leonor Zuzarte: And so we're trying to invoice for like Project A, their hours are nowhere to be found, because they'll only fill in their timesheet at the end of the month when they want an invoice for A, B, C, D, whatever.
[00:54:39] Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
[00:54:41] sindbad ambushed.tv: Because I'm sure, I mean, hopefully they make a note of it somewhere.
[00:54:46] sindbad ambushed.tv: Because otherwise, how would they remember?
[00:54:48] sindbad ambushed.tv: So, yeah, it would make sense that they make a note of it in a place that's accessible to us.
[00:54:52] sindbad ambushed.tv: But yeah.
[00:54:53] Sway Clarke: Alice and Leonhard, do you like this process that it's kind of with the freelancers they can do?
[00:54:59] Sway Clarke: Yes.
[00:54:59] Sway Clarke: to
[00:55:00] Sway Clarke: They have so much wiggle room, so to speak, like they're not saying, hey, please put your hours in within 14 days of your job or something like that.
[00:55:10] Alice Carreto: Thankfully, most of the people, everyone we work with is wonderful, talented, they're great people, they have been vetted and gone through these processes, and most of them are super on top, like they will, as soon as it's the end of the day, they'll put in their hours and their timesheet works and everything.
[00:55:29] Alice Carreto: Everything's fine.
[00:55:31] Alice Carreto: There are a few people that, you know, like Tamara's timesheet, it's not my favorite timesheet.
[00:55:38] Alice Carreto: There are more problematic timesheets.
[00:55:40] Alice Carreto: But Tamara specifically is one of those people who fills it in so regularly and so correctly, but we don't care how bad her timesheet is.
[00:55:49] Alice Carreto: If I message her, if maybe there is one like project that she hasn't filled it in because it finished two days ago or yesterday or super late and she went to bed straight away.
[00:55:59] Alice Carreto: Okay.
[00:55:59] Alice Carreto: Liz Foneman,
[00:56:00] Alice Carreto: She'll reply straight away like, I'm going to do it right now.
[00:56:03] Alice Carreto: So it's great.
[00:56:04] Alice Carreto: There are some people that are a little bit harder to reach.
[00:56:09] Alice Carreto: Like Nora.
[00:56:10] Alice Carreto: Nora won't ever reply through.
[00:56:12] Alice Carreto: She doesn't have WhatsApp.
[00:56:14] Alice Carreto: She won't ever reply through Discord.
[00:56:15] Alice Carreto: So I have to iMessage her.
[00:56:18] Alice Carreto: And then I have to iMessage her to say, hey, can you please fill in your timesheet?
[00:56:22] Alice Carreto: And she's like, yes, I'll do it at the end of the day.
[00:56:25] Alice Carreto: And I'm like, okay.
[00:56:26] Alice Carreto: So then I have to wait until tomorrow.
[00:56:29] Alice Carreto: To check her timesheet.
[00:56:31] Alice Carreto: there's so it's not ideal.
[00:56:34] Alice Carreto: But also, it is what it is.
[00:56:36] Alice Carreto: I don't know if like, we could make them all have the same timesheet.
[00:56:40] sindbad ambushed.tv: And, like, and just one thing I wanted to say, Sway is like, I suspect, you know, so for example, some people they, you know, they charge us, let's say 14 hours, or whatever, 12 hours, they don't, for example, take out the lunch break, whatever.
[00:56:56] sindbad ambushed.tv: So, I mean, we could be a little bit, Finally, Please.
[00:56:59] sindbad ambushed.tv: Thanks.
[00:57:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: Oh, but where is the lunch break or whatever.
[00:57:02] sindbad ambushed.tv: But like, that's just not, we don't want to do it like this.
[00:57:06] sindbad ambushed.tv: So we know, I mean, I'm assuming really that sometimes, you know, they charge us 14 hours and, you know, they might have gone, yeah, like have a long lunch break or whatever.
[00:57:15] sindbad ambushed.tv: But at the end of the day, as long as the hours, as long as we can make the margin, which is where the, you know, you know, we don't want them to take the piss, like, you know, but I think it's kind of also nice to not feel too much like we are, you know, there's trust.
[00:57:29] sindbad ambushed.tv: Basically, I think in this company, I don't know if you would all agree, like we have this thing where every, every month, every, sorry, once a year we're trying or once a year we meet and we like, I think everyone is like, we created like really great relationships between people and trust is really a key thing.
[00:57:46] sindbad ambushed.tv: So I kind of, I do think if we, could improve the processes, that's one thing, but if we, I don't really want to make people feel too much like they're, yeah, like every single thing that they do.
[00:58:02] Madalena Ribeiro da Fonseca: There's also another sort of thing that I think to me it's like very straightforward like everyone's a freelancer like this isn't a big corporate job so we can't be like do this do this for timesheet your availability and then everyone is also an artist and we sort of like the reason this company is so great is because everyone we work with is wonderful we all probably follow each other's instagrams and we share personal projects and like one person's this brand designer and another person's the director of photography and so they all use this as like a sidekick and to be perfectly honest people in like the uk or if they're in holland or whatever they're not paid that much like some people will do this freelance one minute the the cool is gonna run out send everybody a new um link here sorry i just put it in the chat should we should we jump now on it yeah let's jump over there okay okay okay
