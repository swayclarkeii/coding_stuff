[00:00:11] Sway Clarke: Yeah, he's coming back.
[00:00:14] Sway Clarke: I went to Thailand.
[00:00:16] Sway Clarke: He was like, oh, I'm going to Thailand.
[00:00:19] Sway Clarke: Go hang out with my friends.
[00:00:20] Sway Clarke: You get out of my house.
[00:00:21] Sway Clarke: Yeah, and so she's now going to sleep at, I had to pick ZZ up from the kindergarten and I want to go take her to swimming.
[00:00:35] Sway Clarke: Okay, okay.
[00:00:38] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, yeah, That's, uh, yeah, well that's nice that she, the two, your kids get on with her kids, right?
[00:00:49] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like that, right?
[00:00:50] Sway Clarke: They're my, well, my daughter and her daughter are, like, one year apart, and they're friends.
[00:01:03] Sway Clarke: He has one friend actually, the best friend is a girl named Lulu, and he is in the killer's state at Lulu's, and then ZZ, my older daughter, will want to go, and I want to go too, right, so they all have- Hang on, because he's three right now, and she's five, three and five, am I right?
[00:01:29] Sway Clarke: Or am- He'll be three in- Okay.
[00:01:33] Sway Clarke: April.
[00:01:34] Sway Clarke: No, he'll be three in April.
[00:01:36] sindbad ambushed.tv: okay.
[00:01:36] Sway Clarke: She was talking about having another one.
[00:01:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: Oh, really?
[00:01:40] sindbad ambushed.tv: Oh, wow, cool.
[00:01:41] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, yeah, Well, there's such a, yeah, nice ages, right?
[00:01:49] sindbad ambushed.tv: I think the, I mean, it's- The very early ones, or- Yeah, the toughest years right now are the Montego years.
[00:02:00] Sway Clarke: It's like between two and three.
[00:02:04] Sway Clarke: It's like, yeah, it's the time where they're like, I don't have to do what you say anymore.
[00:02:14] Sway Clarke: And so when I say no, what happens?
[00:02:17] sindbad ambushed.tv: What are you going to do?
[00:02:18] Sway Clarke: And this is where parenting becomes very difficult because I just know that's what my dad did.
[00:02:30] Sway Clarke: And just kicked my .
[00:02:31] sindbad ambushed.tv: And then you're like, okay, when he says do that, that's what I do, right?
[00:02:36] Sway Clarke: And so modern parenting is super different.
[00:02:41] Sway Clarke: And, you know, but it's, I don't know, I have my own, I don't know.
[00:02:46] Sway Clarke: I have a blend, right?
[00:02:47] Sway Clarke: There's a point where, go, I'm going to wait till you do that.
[00:02:50] Sway Clarke: And I'm like, nah,  all that , right?
[00:02:52] sindbad ambushed.tv: There's just a point, man.
[00:02:54] Sway Clarke: There's just a point where, I don't know, I think I've said this before, but So, so… I
[00:03:00] Sway Clarke: I think my real feeling is that with us, human beings, we're always like, okay, we got to do this idea, and then we get super dogmatic about it, and then we go over here, and then it's like, kids will not be seen, kids will not be heard, I don't really give a , you sit in the corner, you do what I say, I whip your , you know, and then we go to, like, the extreme, ah, okay, well, that was wrong, so they go to the extreme, like, kids are now, they're dictating what happens, right, like, what do you want to do, where do you want to go, and I think this is not a good, parents are taking, I talk about this with my wife a lot, like, parents are taking, I say, you do a disservice to your kids when you do everything for your kids.
[00:03:55] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't if you is out, she's just like, don't to and what.
[00:04:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: curious to know because, you know, at the moment, Laura and I actually want to have a kid and ask for him why it's a bit, and we, you know, and five years ago, actually, she got pregnant, but we were struggling financially, and I wanted to keep the child, but he said, it's going to make our marriage explode, da, da, da, da, so, you know, it's just so, and, you know, in a way, maybe she was right, but I don't know.
[00:04:30] sindbad ambushed.tv: It is complicated, because I don't know if I would have done the same things, having, maybe things would have panned out completely different, you know, but then still, I don't know.
[00:04:41] sindbad ambushed.tv: Anyway, the point is, I'm thinking, I wonder how, what kind of mother, if it works, like she's going to be, because I think it's almost like, I don't know what kind of that as well, like having expected, like having fought so hard to have a kid, I can't believe it.
[00:05:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: You're working so hard towards this.
[00:05:03] sindbad ambushed.tv: Normally a kid is just something that happens to you, and I'm like, yeah, thank you, dad, I know.
[00:05:12] sindbad ambushed.tv: Thank you, Exactly.
[00:05:16] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's almost like a blessing of the gods, like if it did happen, and maybe we put them too much on a pedestal, you know, this is the thing.
[00:05:25] sindbad ambushed.tv: Whereas normally, you know, in your 20s, you get married and it just happens straight away, you know.
[00:05:32] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's like, if you have  in the past before, you know, you could obviously protect yourself.
[00:05:38] sindbad ambushed.tv: Then, you know, just this time you have , then you have kids, right?
[00:05:41] sindbad ambushed.tv: I mean, it's like, that's just...
[00:05:42] sindbad ambushed.tv: No, you're 100% right, and I think it's a good thing if you're thinking about it.
[00:05:46] Sway Clarke: I wonder how you will be, like, when it happens, because even in theory you're thinking about it, like you said, when the baby comes, it depends on how hard it took, how long it took to get the pain.
[00:06:01] Sway Clarke: I'll give you this scenario.
[00:06:03] Sway Clarke: Yesterday, or a couple days ago, I was at a studio, and in my studio, it's a lot of musicians' studios, and it's like building with all the different studios in there, and I heard a baby crying.
[00:06:13] Sway Clarke: I was like, yo, what the  is that?
[00:06:15] Sway Clarke: Because I got the radar, right?
[00:06:17] Sway Clarke: I got a baby radar, and , I'm like, there's a baby crying, and then I keep doing some more work, and I look, wow, that's a  baby, and I go outside, and in the hallway is a pram with a baby in it, and the baby's crying, and I was like, oh , okay.
[00:06:37] Sway Clarke: So it clicked for me.
[00:06:38] Sway Clarke: Obviously, some woman who's a mother has a studio session, and she's like, yo, I gotta  get this  done.
[00:06:45] Sway Clarke: You're gonna stay out of here, you're gonna go to sleep, and the baby woke up, right?
[00:06:48] Sway Clarke: don't know.
[00:06:49] Sway Clarke: It comes out, and it wasn't even, the thing about it is there was no point for me that I thought she's irresponsible.
[00:06:56] Sway Clarke: I never thought this at all.
[00:06:57] Sway Clarke: I actually thought, yeah, this is
[00:07:00] Sway Clarke: It's  cool, like this is a woman that is a normal human being that's like, I got  to do, I got a business to build, I got things to do, and I'm going to bring you along, and I went home, and I told my wife, because we talk about this a lot, and I was saying, this is one of the most important things that parents need to do, but they forget, and when you get older, I think when you get an older parent, like 40 plus, because I know a lot of them, it's like they just, their whole world becomes about this kid, and everything.
[00:07:30] Sway Clarke: Everything turns to this kid, and you're right, they took a long time to get it, a lot of them tried IVF, a lot of them took the da-da-da-da-da, and now the kid comes, and they forgot about it, and it's like, life is all about like kids, and it's, you obsess about it, because you, because you, you know what I mean, like, yeah, you start obsessing, it's like, you know, what am I, what, I'm 44, I don't have a family, like, it's so important, and then, you know, and, and, and I really say this a lot, it's such a blessing to have kids younger,
[00:08:00] Sway Clarke: Because you just, you don't have the time to think about everything, like, what's the food, what's this, that's that, how much sugar do you have today, how much, when you just have a kid at 20, you're like, yo, you know what, actually this weekend I want to go to the club, I got some friends in here, okay, I got this business, I got to start, I got to work, and you're just like, kid here, kid's like climbing up on some , you're like, yo, I don't got time for that , tell me when you're crying, I'm so sorry.
[00:08:24] Sway Clarke: And now it's like, no, don't climb so high, no, you're gonna get hurt, and it's, and my approach is totally different, like, I'm totally just like, yo, guys, let's get the  going, I don't have time for this , you know, I got  legs to do, you know what I mean, it's just different, I have a different, I'm 44, yeah, so when I had kids, was right at this time, where I could always, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean, hey, we didn't have
[00:09:00] Sway Clarke: We didn't have any problems having kids, so I never had to do the IVF.
[00:09:04] Sway Clarke: I had a lot of friends that do it, and I know the anxiety that this creates, and you know what I mean?
[00:09:09] Sway Clarke: I know that the thing to remember, and this is the only thing that I say, and I learned this, and I don't think people, most people that I know don't think like this.
[00:09:21] Sway Clarke: But I really believe, and having been a parent coach as well, I really believe that this is one of the most important things.
[00:09:26] Sway Clarke: My job is to make sure that when you go out into the world at like 15, 17, 21, 25, I may be dead, that you can handle yourself.
[00:09:43] sindbad ambushed.tv: That's my job.
[00:09:45] Sway Clarke: That's it.
[00:09:46] Sway Clarke: That you go out and you can make  decisions.
[00:09:49] Sway Clarke: You can get an apartment, you can cook your own  food, you can do your  and anxiety, and know how to deal with it, and like you're not.
[00:10:00] Sway Clarke: I'm not  having meltdowns and  because I've taken your whole life experience and I've compressed it into one experience that I just did everything for you.
[00:10:11] Sway Clarke: No, I'm going to touch your food for you.
[00:10:13] Sway Clarke: No, I'm going to clean up the table for you.
[00:10:15] Sway Clarke: No,  that .
[00:10:18] Sway Clarke: Yo, ZZ, your food's on the table, right?
[00:10:21] Sway Clarke: Yo, you spilled your food, you clean that  up.
[00:10:24] Sway Clarke: This is my thing.
[00:10:25] Sway Clarke: And I get it, like, these are skills you're going to have- she more responsible, like, if you compare with other kids, do you feel like that parent- My son, my son, okay, look, Montego is two and a half years old.
[00:10:40] Sway Clarke: Montego can go into the kitchen, open the fridge, take his tower, open the fridge, grab an egg, grab the go to the other side, grab a bowl, put it on the table, crack the egg, put the egg shell in the garbage.
[00:10:55] Sway Clarke: He can mix his egg, put his  salt in it, grab his butter, put
[00:11:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: How old is he?
[00:11:01] sindbad ambushed.tv: He's two and a half.
[00:11:03] sindbad ambushed.tv: He says, that sounds insane.
[00:11:06] Sway Clarke: The only thing he can't do is he can turn on the stove, but he doesn't know yet which stove to turn on with which button and then how to turn it up.
[00:11:18] Sway Clarke: So he'll say, Dad, can you turn the stove on?
[00:11:21] Sway Clarke: He'll get the frying pan himself, he put the butter in, he'll mix his egg, he'll put it in, he'll fry his egg, he'll turn off the stove, he'll put, he'll scrape the food into his plate, and he'll go to the  kitchen, to the table, and he'll eat his food.
[00:11:35] Sway Clarke: And like, I know so many kids, literally, his age, in his kindergarten, they're three, they're four, they're not allowed to touch the stove.
[00:11:44] Sway Clarke: They never touch the stove.
[00:11:45] Sway Clarke: They can't do this, they can't do that.
[00:11:48] Sway Clarke: The parents are like cutting their food for them.
[00:11:50] Sway Clarke: The parents are feeding them water while they're walking out.
[00:11:53] Sway Clarke: And I'm like, guy, pushing them in a kindergarten, like in a pram at four years old.
[00:11:58] Sway Clarke: I'm like guys.
[00:11:58] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, and I'm good.
[00:12:00] Sway Clarke: You know what?
[00:12:00] Sway Clarke: I'm not here to tell you what to do, but I'm telling you that my job is to prepare my  kids for life.
[00:12:06] Sway Clarke: That's it, man.
[00:12:07] Sway Clarke: It's not about- Well, your wife, sorry, don't know if you married your wife or girlfriend, like she's on the same page about that?
[00:12:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: Sure, man.
[00:12:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: For sure.
[00:12:14] sindbad ambushed.tv: For sure.
[00:12:15] Sway Clarke: I mean, it's like, she's from, the thing is my wife is from East Germany.
[00:12:19] Sway Clarke: She grew up in East Germany.
[00:12:20] Sway Clarke: So she has a different perspective on like, I would say comfort and like, you know, she grew up when she went to the supermarket.
[00:12:28] Sway Clarke: Supermarket, there were no bananas.
[00:12:30] Sway Clarke: There was no pineapples.
[00:12:31] Sway Clarke: There were none of these things, right?
[00:12:33] Sway Clarke: And so she kind of gets it.
[00:12:34] Sway Clarke: And my father was like a very, like socialist individual as well, right?
[00:12:41] Sway Clarke: And so we kind of grew up with the same, a lot of the same things of like, yo, you got to get your  together.
[00:12:47] Sway Clarke: Like you got to get this thing done.
[00:12:48] Sway Clarke: You got chores to do.
[00:12:49] Sway Clarke: Like I told my daughter, I'm like, yo, I'm introducing chores, chores.
[00:12:54] Sway Clarke: Yo, look, this is the last thing I'll tell you.
[00:12:56] Sway Clarke: So the other day, my daughter, Zizi, what did she do?
[00:13:03] Sway Clarke: So there's this company that makes peanut butter, yeah?
[00:13:07] Sway Clarke: Peanut butter is like this organic  peanut butter that  people buy.
[00:13:11] Sway Clarke: It's like seven euros for one  thing, yeah?
[00:13:14] sindbad ambushed.tv: So I just bought it.
[00:13:16] Sway Clarke: We just opened it up, put it on the table.
[00:13:18] Sway Clarke: The kids are at the table.
[00:13:19] Sway Clarke: ZZ takes hard-boiled eggs and puts them all in the peanut butter.
[00:13:23] Sway Clarke: Sorry, once again, I thought someone loved it.
[00:13:26] sindbad ambushed.tv: I'm not sure.
[00:13:26] sindbad ambushed.tv: Sorry, I'll be back in a sec.
[00:13:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: Sorry, yeah, so put the egg in the peanut butter, sorry.
[00:13:43] sindbad ambushed.tv: Stuff them in the peanut butter, right?
[00:13:45] Sway Clarke: I come back and Montego's like, hey, Dad, ZZ put the eggs in the peanut butter.
[00:13:50] Sway Clarke: And I'm like, you know what?
[00:13:51] Sway Clarke: So I go on, and I go on a living.
[00:13:52] Sway Clarke: I'm like, yo, dude, what are you doing?
[00:13:54] Sway Clarke: What do you think this is?
[00:13:55] Sway Clarke: And then I try to, I took that thing, I try to get all the eggs out, and it's like really in there, right?
[00:14:00] Sway Clarke: So I'm like, I gotta throw this out now, I gotta throw a whole thing out, and I said, know, Ozzy, you're gonna pay for this, and she's like, well, what do you mean, I'm like, you're gonna pay for this, like, you got money, right, you got money, yeah, but she'll collect money around, we'll go around the city, we'll collect bottles, like, on the street, and then she'll take them to the supermarket, and then she can exchange them for money, and then she'll get the money, yeah, and I'm like, whatever you get, you keep, right, and you gotta learn, like, when you use it, it's done, you can do whatever you want, I'm teaching her how to, like, invest, what invest means, we take this money, and make more money, yeah, but oftentimes, she's like, I wanna buy gummy bears, I'm like, , I don't care, buy your gummy bears, so, I'm like, yo, you're gonna have to pay for this, she's like, how much is it, I'm like, I don't know, she's like, okay, well, we're gonna go to the supermarket, we're gonna get the peanut butter, and I'm gonna buy the gummy bears, I'm like, I don't know how much money you have, and I don't know how much it's gonna cost, but we're gonna see this, right, so we go to the supermarket, I get the  peanut butter, and I'm like, okay, to the
[00:15:00] Sway Clarke: It's $5.99.
[00:15:01] Sway Clarke: How much money do you have?
[00:15:02] Sway Clarke: And we go through all of the change in it, and she has $5.90.
[00:15:09] Sway Clarke: And I'm like, okay, this is all mine.
[00:15:14] Sway Clarke: And she's looking at me like, what?
[00:15:17] Sway Clarke: And my wife's there.
[00:15:19] Sway Clarke: She's like, you're going to do this?
[00:15:23] Sway Clarke: And I'm like,  yeah, I'm going to do this.
[00:15:26] Sway Clarke: And I was like, actually, you owe me five cents.
[00:15:36] Sway Clarke: And I'm like, you know what?
[00:15:40] Sway Clarke: Look, Z, you've got to understand, like, this is money.
[00:15:43] Sway Clarke: This is value.
[00:15:44] sindbad ambushed.tv: You know, it costs me money.
[00:15:45] Sway Clarke: You've got to understand what this is.
[00:15:47] Sway Clarke: But at this point, I knew there would be no parents wouldn't do this .
[00:15:51] Sway Clarke: The parents that I know would not do this .
[00:15:53] Sway Clarke: Even my wife told me, she's like, when I looked at her face, I was like, I don't think I could have done it.
[00:15:57] Sway Clarke: And was like, that's why I'm here.
[00:15:59] Sway Clarke: Because
[00:16:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: I'm going to do this , and she's got to learn, and then you know what happened a week later, something happened, and I was like, look Z, if you're going to waste that, you're going to have to pay for it, and she was like, actually, okay, okay, let me think about, okay, you know what, then I don't want to, I don't want all this, right, like, let me just take what I, and I'm, but you know what, because I'm, I'm really interested, because I think I would like, I would love to parent like this, I think the risk, and then maybe we, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, the risk of that, because I think it's, it's great, but you don't want to be always the super rigid, always like rule, and you know, do you know what mean, like, it's also nice, maybe to have a side of you that's a bit fun as well, right, I mean, I'm sure you have it, but like, you know what I'm trying to say, like, you could become this ultra rigid, ultra rule-oriented choice, and then it's like the army, maybe, you don't want that either, right, that you have to find a balance, no?
[00:16:51] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't know.
[00:16:52] Sway Clarke: No, it's true, I mean, like, I don't take her money all the time, right, you know, in a, in a, a, in a perfect world, but
[00:17:00] Sway Clarke: It's like, for me, it's just, how do I parent?
[00:17:06] Sway Clarke: I parent that I'm very hands off.
[00:17:09] Sway Clarke: Like, you guys have, you guys want to do things, you figure it out.
[00:17:13] Sway Clarke: I'm just here to help you out.
[00:17:14] Sway Clarke: Like, you want to go to these places, you want to do, you want to  put tomato juice on your face at the dinner table.
[00:17:20] Sway Clarke: I really don't care.
[00:17:22] Sway Clarke: That's okay with me.
[00:17:23] Sway Clarke: If you're going to do it, clean it up.
[00:17:25] Sway Clarke: If you're going to do this, this is what's going to happen.
[00:17:27] Sway Clarke: Because this is just, to me, it's just like, it's more a matter of, I've got to let you feel the natural consequence of what you do.
[00:17:38] Sway Clarke: But it's not about, that wasn't about me being rigid.
[00:17:40] Sway Clarke: It was more like, you just have to feel this consequence right now.
[00:17:44] sindbad ambushed.tv: No, Fair enough.
[00:17:45] sindbad ambushed.tv: No, no, exactly.
[00:17:45] sindbad ambushed.tv: No, no.
[00:17:46] sindbad ambushed.tv: I mean, I honestly, I think it's great.
[00:17:48] sindbad ambushed.tv: I just, I wonder how you, because I do, I have become actually through work, actually, I've become a very meticulous guy, which I don't think I was in my twenties.
[00:17:58] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's something that happened in my thirties.
[00:18:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: And I do, and I have to say, and that's a little bit different, but like, you know, when it comes to, because maybe they're still too young, but like going to school, et cetera, like people who are sloppy, and that's why I have to say, I'm really admiring the way you work.
[00:18:12] sindbad ambushed.tv: I really, like, you're obviously very thorough, and I think precise, thorough, and that's, I think that's a really important skill to have, but you could become like this pain in the  person who's like overly attention to detail.
[00:18:27] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, I don't know.
[00:18:28] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't want to be the, like a pain in the butt either.
[00:18:30] sindbad ambushed.tv: I mean, I'm saying this, I don't even know if we're going to succeed to have a kid, but like, I'm thinking you have to, you know, but I'm also a fun person.
[00:18:37] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, I love to play sport.
[00:18:38] sindbad ambushed.tv: I'd play football with a kid or whatever.
[00:18:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: I'm sure I would do.
[00:18:41] sindbad ambushed.tv: But yeah, I have these values.
[00:18:42] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't know.
[00:18:42] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's, it's, it's a tough one.
[00:18:43] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, I do think it's, you could go extreme in this kind of thing where you're like, yeah, like overly, you know, what's the, sorry, the words come in French, but, you know, like, demanding about everything, know, I don't know, but.
[00:19:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: But it's a balance.
[00:19:01] Sway Clarke: It's like, you know, for example, I balance this where my kids, I won't say my kids have more fun with me, but like, you know, we go ice skating, we go, you know, we go climbing, we go, you know, we go play foosball, you know, we go for walks, we go bike riding.
[00:19:23] Sway Clarke: I know that my kids enjoy being with me, and we have a lot of fun.
[00:19:28] Sway Clarke: And so, but there are times where the fun ends.
[00:19:33] Sway Clarke: And I'm not your, like, I'm not your friend.
[00:19:36] Sway Clarke: And it's okay, because my job is not to make you happy every moment of the day.
[00:19:41] Sway Clarke: My job is to help you learn and help you figure things out.
[00:19:44] Sway Clarke: So like, again, this experience of having the money and stuff like this, it's not like every time she wastes food, I'm always like, yo, but I do, but I do gently remind
[00:20:00] Sway Clarke: For example, yo, look, when you're gonna take your food out, just take what you need.
[00:20:05] Sway Clarke: Don't waste food.
[00:20:07] Sway Clarke: And that is a constant thing in our house.
[00:20:09] Sway Clarke: We don't like to waste food.
[00:20:10] Sway Clarke: I don't want you to learn to waste food.
[00:20:11] Sway Clarke: So that maybe it might be something she grows up with and like, man, my parents were always on about not wasting food.
[00:20:18] Sway Clarke: But I think that's okay.
[00:20:20] Sway Clarke: No, no, you're right.
[00:20:21] sindbad ambushed.tv: You have to have values.
[00:20:22] sindbad ambushed.tv: you know, and that is where also I think it's interesting.
[00:20:25] sindbad ambushed.tv: And because it's like, when you become a parent, like, I know we have slightly different values about these things with Laura, for example, and like, she values certain things more than me.
[00:20:35] sindbad ambushed.tv: And so that's the other thing with the parents.
[00:20:38] sindbad ambushed.tv: I imagine that can be explosive as well, right?
[00:20:40] Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah, yeah, That will come out where you're like, yo, I didn't know you  believed in that .
[00:20:46] Sway Clarke: And she'd be like, what?
[00:20:48] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, what am I saying?
[00:20:50] sindbad ambushed.tv: Would you disagree with the, in front of the kids and the kids can see, okay, they just have two different positions and that's fine.
[00:20:57] sindbad ambushed.tv: Or do you prefer to show?
[00:20:59] sindbad ambushed.tv: So, okay.
[00:21:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: We're the same, like, like present the same thing together because you want to be a, yeah, like parenting the same way.
[00:21:08] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, is that, is that.
[00:21:08] Sway Clarke: We will, we agree that if you've made it a decision, I'm not going to go back on that decision because you made a decision.
[00:21:18] Sway Clarke: Yeah.
[00:21:18] Sway Clarke: And I'll tell you, you'll know what my thought is because I'll tell you, okay, well, if you go on that, that's cool.
[00:21:24] Sway Clarke: I'm going to follow it.
[00:21:25] Sway Clarke: But, um, and we do, we, we often time often, we have argued in front of the kids about things.
[00:21:32] Sway Clarke: And I also think that's okay because it's like, again, it's like, my job is not to shelter you from the world.
[00:21:42] Sway Clarke: My job is for you to see that I'm a human being, your mom's a human being, like, for example, whenever we argue, we've had arguments and my wife starts crying.
[00:21:51] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:21:51] Sway Clarke: Okay.
[00:21:52] Sway Clarke: And, and Zizi will be like, um, Dada, how come you don't cry?
[00:21:56] Sway Clarke: How come you never cry?
[00:21:57] Sway Clarke: And I'm like, no, it's not that I never.
[00:22:00] Sway Clarke: I cry about different things.
[00:22:02] Sway Clarke: And your mom cries about different things, right?
[00:22:04] Sway Clarke: And your mom just tends to get emotional sometimes when we have conversations, right?
[00:22:09] Sway Clarke: But it's okay.
[00:22:10] Sway Clarke: Like, we cry, we argue, and then we, you know, we hug it out, and we love each other, and it's clear.
[00:22:16] Sway Clarke: But I also want my daughter to see that we argue, and then we work it out.
[00:22:23] Sway Clarke: But if we never argue, I think it's super weird when people are like, I've never seen my parents argue.
[00:22:29] Sway Clarke: It's like you've never learned, that means you as a person have never learned how an argument happens with an individual, and how to fix an argument, and how you get through an argument, and like, you never learned that.
[00:22:41] Sway Clarke: So now you're going to get a boyfriend or girlfriend, and then you're going to get into an argument, and you're going to, like, know how to deal with it.
[00:22:48] Sway Clarke: And so, again, right, I think sometimes we're going to think, oh, I'm helping my kids, but it's like, not really.
[00:22:55] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:55] sindbad ambushed.tv: Not really.
[00:22:56] Sway Clarke: You're not really helping them.
[00:22:57] Sway Clarke: We gotta teach them.
[00:22:58] Sway Clarke: But anyways.
[00:22:59] Sway Clarke: I know.
[00:23:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: But yeah, no, well, yeah, sorry, so, super interesting, and again, I hope really at some point we're in the same city and we can grab a drink and, yeah, yeah, yeah, I've got to come out to Amsterdam.
[00:23:11] sindbad ambushed.tv: Or me to Berlin, like, we have friends in the, in fact, I've been to Berlin only once in my life, and we have friends in Germany, not so much in Berlin, actually, but we, anyway, maybe it will happen.
[00:23:22] sindbad ambushed.tv: But yeah, so, thank you so much, by the way, like, these, I mean, yeah, that call, like, everyone is super, like, really, yeah, loved you, and like, you know, they said, you know, it's amazing, like, I think they're very excited about the potential, and, you know, as you can see, they're amazing, right, like, they're so serious, they're so motivated, and I feel blessed to have a good team, a good bunch of individuals there, I have to say, that really care about what they do, and really take initiative, you know, you can also see that if there's a problem, like, Madalina, she's like, I'm going to go online and
[00:24:00] Sway Clarke: This is a great character trait that a lot of people don't have, right?
[00:24:05] Sway Clarke: And it does look like you're taking care of them, like they kind of get this sense that they're valued, and it's really cool.
[00:24:14] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's one thing I have to say, know, maybe I was telling you at some point, like with my business partner, there were moments that were a bit tricky, but one of the things that he like pushed me to do is give more responsibilities to people and like trust them more than I would naturally do, because I was maybe, you know, tend to be a little bit too kind of micromanaging a little bit.
[00:24:35] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like I had that tendency, and he taught me to stop it.
[00:24:40] sindbad ambushed.tv: I always said, it's because you're lazy, because you don't want to, you know, in the end, it works.
[00:24:46] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like we, I think we're really, yeah, we're really happy that people seem to be happy in the job.
[00:24:51] sindbad ambushed.tv: And, you know, as I was telling you, one of the reasons we do all this calculation is like we motivate, like people basically get more money when there's more income.
[00:25:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's like everyone is kind of, you know, yeah, like there's this real thing that I think we pay the people fairly, and anyway, it's nice to see, and they're great people, but yeah, so, and I think there's so many little things, so obviously the thing that worries me a little bit is if, because we've been so much sure of your time you've spent already, and if suddenly you come, you tell me it's going to cost something, and it's like way out of our budget, then, you know, it's going to be, I will have felt like I've wasted so much of your time, so this is why I wanted to get a bulk idea, you know, like a ballpark idea of what it may cost, and so that I can also come to, go to Pierre and say, listen, I think this will be super useful in the long run, not only is it going to save money, but it's going to make our team happier, and as you said, like, for example, Alice, she's great, like, she's wasting a lot of time doing all these things, and if she, I don't think what would happen is that if we kind of, if we saved her that, I don't think what would happen is that there
[00:26:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: They would just, you know, do nothing.
[00:26:02] sindbad ambushed.tv: I think they would, because they're so motivated, they would probably go and, like, spend more time, like, writing to a client, maybe pick up the phone, call them and say, you know, this overdue, because that's a big problem that we have, all these clients that don't pay the  invoice.
[00:26:18] sindbad ambushed.tv: And I think this is something that they could have more time to address.
[00:26:21] sindbad ambushed.tv: And, you know, I mean, it's also not fun, but it's very important that we get all that money.
[00:26:26] sindbad ambushed.tv: And in other words, like, wait, all of this time spent doing these tasks, you know, maybe, like, we should address these, we shouldn't tolerate, like, people paying, like, four months later, six months later.
[00:26:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: And I think we, because they're so caught up in the stuff, like, you know, anyway, it's just an example, the sort of things that they, yeah, it's a product, right?
[00:26:47] Sway Clarke: I mean, you know, I think I've been thinking about it today.
[00:26:50] Sway Clarke: And I kind of wonder if sometimes you can look with a system and you're like, the system creates the behavior in the people.
[00:27:00] Sway Clarke: Or do the people create the behavior of the system?
[00:27:03] Sway Clarke: And I think right now what's happening is because of the system, it's creating a behavior in the workers.
[00:27:08] Sway Clarke: Because they end up having to do all of these tasks.
[00:27:12] Sway Clarke: So when they're like moving around and updating here and da-da-da-da-da-da, it creates the fact that they don't have a certain amount of time, the things that they have to prioritize, and then the things that they can kind of focus on.
[00:27:24] Sway Clarke: So it's kind of like because of the system, the way the system is, you're getting a certain type of productivity.
[00:27:33] Sway Clarke: You're getting a certain type of worker, right?
[00:27:35] Sway Clarke: As opposed to like, okay, here are the people, let's build this system based on an individual, right?
[00:27:42] Sway Clarke: And it's fine, like Madalena said it, hey, I started this thing, we kind of just got it together, and every, you know, I was always building, I was always building, I was always building.
[00:27:52] Sway Clarke: But it was built in a certain way that was kind of like, okay, we got to get past this problem.
[00:27:57] Sway Clarke: So let's build this new thing to cover.
[00:28:00] Sway Clarke: And it's totally fine.
[00:28:02] Sway Clarke: It's totally normal.
[00:28:03] Sway Clarke: I think the thing is, when you're talking about money, you're saying like, OK, I don't know how much it's going to cost.
[00:28:11] Sway Clarke: What is the system we're going to build?
[00:28:13] Sway Clarke: OK, so the way that I usually work is this.
[00:28:18] Sway Clarke: Obviously, you can always go two ways.
[00:28:19] Sway Clarke: You can go based off of budget, or you can go based off of what we need to build.
[00:28:25] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:28:26] Sway Clarke: And budget is always a bit difficult when you're like, OK, this is this is how much I have.
[00:28:30] Sway Clarke: And then what can we build based on that?
[00:28:32] Sway Clarke: But it is a restraint.
[00:28:34] Sway Clarke: It is a constraint.
[00:28:35] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:28:35] Sway Clarke: If you're like, hey, this is all the money that we have.
[00:28:37] Sway Clarke: We don't have anything more.
[00:28:38] Sway Clarke: This is kind of what we're looking at.
[00:28:39] Sway Clarke: Then I think it's something to be addressed.
[00:28:42] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:28:42] Sway Clarke: It is something to be addressed.
[00:28:43] Sway Clarke: I mean, I'm not coming to you saying, hey, I'm going to build you a new system for twenty five thousand euros and this is what it's going to be.
[00:28:48] Sway Clarke: That's not the way I think about it.
[00:28:51] Sway Clarke: But what I need to do still is I need to kind of look at the way I kind of do it is lay out.
[00:29:00] Sway Clarke: Here are the possibilities.
[00:29:02] Sway Clarke: Here are the things we could build, and here are the things that will take very quick time, and this is the impact they'll have.
[00:29:11] Sway Clarke: Here are the things that will be very time intensive to build, and they will be more expensive, and this is the impact that they'll have.
[00:29:17] Sway Clarke: And we can kind of, you know, if we do it in a way we build a roadmap that we start from here, and it's not something that we're like going to fix the whole system in a month or write it with the first build, but we build a roadmap that says, okay, in a year, or in six months, or in 12 months, or in, you know what I mean?
[00:29:37] Sway Clarke: This is how we build this.
[00:29:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: And we can also, if I understand properly as well, like pay you, not in installments, but we do first the tasks that we can afford.
[00:29:50] Sway Clarke: The way I work with, the way I like to work with clients is that it's not like I'm going to come in and say, hey, what do you want?
[00:29:57] Sway Clarke: Oh, you want a website?
[00:29:58] Sway Clarke: Okay, cool.
[00:29:58] Sway Clarke: Here's a website.
[00:29:59] Sway Clarke: Boom, boom, boom.
[00:29:59] Sway Clarke: Next.
[00:30:00] Sway Clarke: And I move on to the next person.
[00:30:01] Sway Clarke: It's, like I said, it's a transformation partner, right?
[00:30:05] Sway Clarke: I'm here to help you take your systems and move them into like a modern approach of efficiency.
[00:30:12] Sway Clarke: And so whatever that starts with, you know, it could, I mean, just, I'm really just rambling off my head because I want to like take all of the information.
[00:30:21] Sway Clarke: want to take the transcripts, take the call and like go through it.
[00:30:24] Sway Clarke: And so two things.
[00:30:26] Sway Clarke: My approach is I want to put this into a bit of a proposal form.
[00:30:30] Sway Clarke: I'm at where I'd be like, here are my findings.
[00:30:32] Sway Clarke: Here's what I think would give the best approach.
[00:30:36] Sway Clarke: Have you all like the three of you also give feedback on it?
[00:30:41] Sway Clarke: Yeah, this is a real problem.
[00:30:42] Sway Clarke: Yeah.
[00:30:42] Sway Clarke: Okay.
[00:30:42] Sway Clarke: This is what we like.
[00:30:43] Sway Clarke: And then we kind of, then I kind of got to look at, okay, if we're going to build this thing out, what is the potential cost for it?
[00:30:50] Sway Clarke: Right?
[00:30:50] Sway Clarke: Like then, then what does it look like?
[00:30:51] Sway Clarke: And we can decide like, Hey, you know what?
[00:30:53] Sway Clarke: This is a really big project and we'd like to get there, but maybe we break it up into pieces.
[00:30:59] Sway Clarke: Maybe.
[00:31:00] Sway Clarke: We break this big thing up into smaller pieces over time, and so it's a bit dynamic, and I think in your case, there's a lot of moving parts, you know, there's a lot of things that can happen, and you can very quickly be like, my job is really to kind of break this down to, okay, let's break this down to parts.
[00:31:21] Sway Clarke: If we implement this little thing here, what effect will that have, how long is that going to take, and how quickly can we do that, you know what I mean?
[00:31:29] Sway Clarke: And then what will be the next part of that, you know?
[00:31:31] Sway Clarke: And so we build it out in phases, we build it out in time, but my next step would be to kind of sit down with everything we got, look at what, like where the problems are really, and what we can, what can be potential solutions, and then I would bring back to you all and say, okay, look, this is what I've got.
[00:31:56] Sway Clarke: How does this sound?
[00:31:57] Sway Clarke: Does this sound right?
[00:31:58] Sway Clarke: And then you...
[00:32:00] Sway Clarke: You and I would have to talk about the cost, right?
[00:32:05] sindbad ambushed.tv: I'm just wondering if when I should loop Pierre in, because maybe next, you know, so let's say the next call, should I bring him in?
[00:32:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: Maybe, I don't know, because I'm just, I just want him to be obviously on board, like see also how, you know, experience, like talking to you, you know, because he's, I mean, it's also about the people, like, you know, if he appreciates you, it's going to help.
[00:32:24] sindbad ambushed.tv: So I think, again, I don't know what the costs are, like maybe the one thing you need to know, which is a problem that we have at the moment, and hopefully we won't have it anymore, but last year we made so many investments in terms of people, and then the, so our margin has gone down a lot, because one thing is the margin per project, but the amount of fixed people that we have has grown, meaning, and also there's the old AI thing, which is, you know, which means that Pierre and I have had like really two terrible months, which is fine, but it means, yeah, it's more
[00:33:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: There's in the conversation where I think there is, and he's also very, but like he's a big AI kind of person.
[00:33:07] sindbad ambushed.tv: He wants to go forward, like he wants to implement.
[00:33:09] sindbad ambushed.tv: So he's very much someone who would, he reacted really positively to the whole process.
[00:33:14] sindbad ambushed.tv: But yeah, I don't know.
[00:33:17] sindbad ambushed.tv: We'll have to just see.
[00:33:18] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's just one of those things where until, yeah, like I think there is some money that we can spend immediately for sure, but it's going to be, it's just this moment where we're waiting to see if our clients are going to really not have a problem with the increase.
[00:33:32] sindbad ambushed.tv: And then maybe we actually in a, maybe in three months time, we're like, okay, we actually are comfortable.
[00:33:38] sindbad ambushed.tv: We are more comfortable.
[00:33:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: We are, but there's the, there's a lot of, let's say, little question marks in this, you know, because of the, you know, also this AI thing, because basically we've increased the price and we explain our clients, we increase the price because there's also this AI demand.
[00:33:53] sindbad ambushed.tv: So, I am a little bit worried that it means, okay, now we can go crazy with the AI, you know, if every client
[00:34:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: The want to push the AI like 100% because they feel like they have the right to because we said that's why we increased the, you know, so it's all like, yeah, there's a few things, but anyway, I'm almost certain, you know, that we will one way or another use your services, I think, but I'm just a little bit, yeah, if it was going to be something where people are like, oh, I really can't afford it, like worse, worse, worse case scenario, was going to say, which really I hope it won't happen, but like, I would like to have, if Pia said, no, we can't afford it at the moment, blah, blah, blah, then, you know, at least pay you for all the time that you've spent because I feel like that, I feel just, yeah, a bit, like, no, I appreciate that, I appreciate that, I mean, I have to say, I'm a bit, I'm also a bit nervous of Pia, I don't know this person, and I don't know if he's going to be like the guy that shuts everything down, no, no, no, no, no, he's not at all, like, he's very, he's a very open-minded guy, but it's true that we, I think we both have been a little bit under pressure for the past two months, because of what I've experienced.
[00:35:01] sindbad ambushed.tv: We made, I think, right decisions for the comfort of our teams, because they were a bit under too much pressure, but it also means that we had to increase, and we just hope that clients are not going to go away, to be honest.
[00:35:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: mean, I think you haven't seen, because you've seen some of the work that I think we really deliver an amazing service, and that's why people keep coming, and still you don't want to take advantage of that.
[00:35:24] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, I see what you're saying.
[00:35:26] Sway Clarke: I mean, you're raising your prices.
[00:35:29] Sway Clarke: It sounds like you're a bit nervous about it, which totally makes sense.
[00:35:32] Sway Clarke: You're like, I don't know what's going happen, right?
[00:35:34] Sway Clarke: And so, and I totally understand that.
[00:35:37] Sway Clarke: I totally get that.
[00:35:37] Sway Clarke: I think, I mean, the thing for me, how do I say this?
[00:35:44] Sway Clarke: It really depends on what, okay, two things.
[00:35:48] Sway Clarke: I think we should rope Pierre in as soon as we can, as soon as possible, because I think that getting him on board, getting him in the loop before it's like, this is what the cost
[00:36:00] Sway Clarke: I think that's, I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:36:03] Sway Clarke: Right?
[00:36:03] Sway Clarke: So I think that, um, the next call.
[00:36:05] sindbad ambushed.tv: So the call when you're presenting your ideas and you, and you have a debate with, you know, with Maddalena, Alyssa, you know, and everyone, I think that's when he should be present.
[00:36:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: I'm going to make sure he is because that way, you know, okay, he missed the whole first part.
[00:36:18] sindbad ambushed.tv: We can always send him by the way, the, the summary, the AI summary.
[00:36:22] sindbad ambushed.tv: So you can see what we've been talking about.
[00:36:24] sindbad ambushed.tv: And I think that's, yeah, I think that makes a little sense that to me.
[00:36:28] Sway Clarke: I'm trying to think about this.
[00:36:29] Sway Clarke: Um, I'm trying to think about this in terms of time wise, like if it makes sense to have like another call with him, like just in general, to have a call where we just talk about, you know what I mean?
[00:36:45] Sway Clarke: So he can kind of express himself without the employees, because it might be weird for him to, but I didn't, so what I could say is, listen, we've, we have, we're really happy with the way it went with Sway.
[00:36:57] sindbad ambushed.tv: Before we, he presents all of his ideas.
[00:37:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: Because the only thing, the other thing is, I think he also might have other ideas of how to implement AI.
[00:37:05] sindbad ambushed.tv: So, you know, it might be useful, you know, because he's thinking, yeah, so yeah, again, my only worry is like, it's more of your time.
[00:37:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: But if you, if you think, I think strategically, it's not a bad idea, yeah, like for, yeah.
[00:37:19] Sway Clarke: Yeah, I think that might be the best thing to bring him in sooner than later, see, and get his thoughts, right?
[00:37:25] Sway Clarke: Like, this is our finding, this is what I found, this is what I'm thinking, this is what we found on the calls.
[00:37:29] Sway Clarke: And are you feeling the same thing?
[00:37:31] Sway Clarke: Have you seen the same thing?
[00:37:32] Sway Clarke: There might be some things that he's like, I didn't know about all of this, right?
[00:37:35] Sway Clarke: Or you might say, actually, I did know, but I didn't have a solution for it.
[00:37:39] Sway Clarke: And, and, or he may have some ideas, which I think would also be really great, right?
[00:37:44] Sway Clarke: exactly.
[00:37:44] Sway Clarke: And I have also other ideas.
[00:37:46] sindbad ambushed.tv: mean, I mentioned one, which is, you know, kind of scanning the, I think we need to, I mean, that's a different, maybe it's not directly, you know, it's, it's this thing of like monitoring the AI, you know, because this big thing, like, big account has the problem, as you said, like, they could,
[00:38:04] sindbad ambushed.tv: So we need to find a solution about this, but I know it's not directly what you can implement into the processes, but anyway, I think it's useful, it would be useful, so yeah, and just so you know, that's the thing, because I like things to be fair, so I don't think he's going to shut anything down, let's do the call with him, I think it's a great idea, and then if by the worst possible scenario, for some reason, like there was no, outcome, I would want to somehow compensate you for all the time, because I, yeah, that's all I wanted to say, you know, just because I, you never know, right, like, you know, if we have a really , oh, oh, it might be, we push it by a few months, if we have a really, really  January, that's, you know what I mean, like, we're gonna be, we, because that's the thing, as I said, like, our margins have gone down to the point that, like, Pierre and I can't pay ourselves very well, you know, like, like, I mean, before, you know, it's like, we haven't lost money, but it's becoming really,
[00:39:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: You're like, okay, that's not, you know, we didn't create this business.
[00:39:03] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's almost like we had such a good year before and like suddenly we have, because of this money increase and the low and the lower.
[00:39:09] sindbad ambushed.tv: In other words, I do think psychologically, you know, how well we're doing in terms of turnover is going to affect for sure, you know, how our perception of how we, what we can invest, you know?
[00:39:20] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah.
[00:39:21] sindbad ambushed.tv: I want to be honest with about that.
[00:39:22] sindbad ambushed.tv: No, no.
[00:39:23] Sway Clarke: Hey, I mean, it's all good.
[00:39:26] Sway Clarke: I get it.
[00:39:26] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:39:27] Sway Clarke: I totally get it.
[00:39:27] Sway Clarke: No, really.
[00:39:28] Sway Clarke: I totally get it.
[00:39:29] Sway Clarke: And, you know, it's, it's, it's just, it's what it is.
[00:39:32] Sway Clarke: You know, we kind of figured out, I think with Pierre, to rope him in as soon as possible.
[00:39:37] Sway Clarke: I think that's probably a better idea.
[00:39:39] Sway Clarke: think a lot of people don't like to come into a call and get a price and general like what, you know, what is, where, where did everything come from?
[00:39:45] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:39:46] Sway Clarke: And especially you told me a bit about your dynamic already.
[00:39:48] Sway Clarke: And you're, you know, you're kind of in these spaces.
[00:39:50] Sway Clarke: So I think it's good to bring him in and, let him feel useful and let him feel like a part of it.
[00:39:55] Sway Clarke: hundred percent.
[00:39:55] Sway Clarke: So I'll send you, um, another link.
[00:39:58] Sway Clarke: You can.
[00:39:59] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yes.
[00:40:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, let's do that.
[00:40:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: So I'll speak to him.
[00:40:01] sindbad ambushed.tv: I've already sent him a message after I called earlier.
[00:40:03] sindbad ambushed.tv: So I'm going to probably, oh, here you go.
[00:40:06] sindbad ambushed.tv: He's replied.
[00:40:09] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, perfect.
[00:40:10] sindbad ambushed.tv: So I think he's all, you know, very optimistic about it.
[00:40:15] sindbad ambushed.tv: So let me, well, I'll book a call maybe.
[00:40:18] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, next week.
[00:40:19] sindbad ambushed.tv: Hang on.
[00:40:20] sindbad ambushed.tv: Next week is a little bit weird for me because I have Richard and Alesh coming to work on the, on ball move, like trying to push things with ball move.
[00:40:30] sindbad ambushed.tv: So, uh, but maybe they're coming, maybe we could do Monday or Tuesday from Wednesday.
[00:40:35] sindbad ambushed.tv: They're going to be here.
[00:40:36] sindbad ambushed.tv: They would work though.
[00:40:38] sindbad ambushed.tv: So maybe better do it Monday, Tuesday, and then push it to the week after basically from the 21st, 21st to 23rd.
[00:40:46] sindbad ambushed.tv: can't really, but the availability Monday, Tuesday.
[00:40:51] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah.
[00:40:51] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah.
[00:40:51] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah.
[00:40:52] sindbad ambushed.tv: We can do something for that.
[00:40:52] Sway Clarke: Let me get my calendar.
[00:40:55] Sway Clarke: Where's my calendar?
[00:40:57] Sway Clarke: Yeah.
[00:40:58] Sway Clarke: So I'll send another.
[00:41:07] sindbad ambushed.tv: So should I best email?
[00:41:09] Sway Clarke: Should I just email it to you?
[00:41:10] Sway Clarke: No, that's fine.
[00:41:11] sindbad ambushed.tv: WhatsApp is great.
[00:41:12] sindbad ambushed.tv: I use WhatsApp a lot.
[00:41:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: And I have it on my computer.
[00:41:14] sindbad ambushed.tv: So yeah, that's perfect, actually.
[00:41:16] Sway Clarke: Okay, so I think what I will do then is I'll...
[00:41:19] Sway Clarke: I think I have to update my WhatsApp on my computer here.
[00:41:24] Sway Clarke: I will send you the link.
[00:41:26] Sway Clarke: We'll have a call.
[00:41:27] Sway Clarke: So we should have a call with Pierre, the three of us.
[00:41:30] sindbad ambushed.tv: I can kind of...
[00:41:31] Sway Clarke: It won't be a full proposal.
[00:41:34] Sway Clarke: Like I'm not going to have like a whole presentation or anything like this.
[00:41:37] Sway Clarke: But I will have like the whole talking points.
[00:41:41] Sway Clarke: Like I'll know what to talk about.
[00:41:42] Sway Clarke: And then I'll tell him about my findings, the thoughts.
[00:41:45] sindbad ambushed.tv: You can tell him about yours.
[00:41:47] Sway Clarke: And then he can tell us about his.
[00:41:49] Sway Clarke: We can just kind of share ideas.
[00:41:50] Sway Clarke: And then I would like to put something together to talk, to talk about.
[00:41:57] Sway Clarke: And if, if there is a...
[00:42:00] Sway Clarke: If where I need to talk with the girls again, then I would just set something up with them because there just may be a point where I'm like, there's something that's still missing in terms of like me understanding your system.
[00:42:12] Sway Clarke: And I told them as well that I would like set up a call with them to just to just talk about it.
[00:42:18] Sway Clarke: If that's the case.
[00:42:19] Sway Clarke: Hang on.
[00:42:19] Sway Clarke: Let me see.
[00:42:20] Sway Clarke: What's that start yet?
[00:42:21] Sway Clarke: No.
[00:42:22] sindbad ambushed.tv: And honestly, there's so such bright girls, all of them, that I just think like honestly, all of the time that we would save, like they're going to be able to find new way, like, like, I'm sure that it's going to be very beneficial for the business because they're going to be there and motivate, like they'll have time that they can use doing all sorts of things.
[00:42:40] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like they get, as you said, they have, they, they, they all have, um, uh, what's the word you use?
[00:42:46] sindbad ambushed.tv: Sorry.
[00:42:49] sindbad ambushed.tv: initiative.
[00:42:49] sindbad ambushed.tv: so they will have new initiatives that they can't have now, of course, because they're too busy.
[00:42:53] sindbad ambushed.tv: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:55] Sway Clarke: It's I have to say, like, um, I don't think it's about Oh.
[00:42:59] Sway Clarke: Yeah.
[00:42:59] Sway Clarke: Bye.
[00:43:00] Sway Clarke: I mean, I wouldn't put this as it's about whether you want to fix your systems or not.
[00:43:05] Sway Clarke: I think how quickly you want to fix your systems versus how long it'll take, because the truth is, in terms of time, you're just you're bleeding time.
[00:43:15] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah.
[00:43:16] sindbad ambushed.tv: This is what it is.
[00:43:17] Sway Clarke: And and at the end of the day, your businesses, whether it be whether it be them having more time to help you with bold moves, whether it be them having more time to help you build that margin back up with with ambushed, you need more time from them.
[00:43:33] Sway Clarke: And they only work a certain amount of days and you're not getting any more days out of them because you're not paying them.
[00:43:38] Sway Clarke: So you've got to make their time way more productive.
[00:43:42] Sway Clarke: You have to make their time way more productive.
[00:43:44] sindbad ambushed.tv: Right.
[00:43:45] Sway Clarke: That money that you're talking about, like seeing those numbers of like this is all the outstanding money.
[00:43:49] Sway Clarke: Like you've got to try to get the system to where you can get the money in 30 days.
[00:43:56] Sway Clarke: You really can't because they get the invoice.
[00:43:58] Sway Clarke: They get the clarity.
[00:43:59] Sway Clarke: Thank you much.
[00:43:59] Sway Clarke: Bye.
[00:44:00] Sway Clarke: They get the payment, they get the reminder, they get the reminder for the payment, all of that.
[00:44:04] sindbad ambushed.tv: But the clients, trust me, they're like nightmare.
[00:44:06] sindbad ambushed.tv: They can be a nightmare.
[00:44:06] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like some are really good, but like, I think it's more, and you know, we threaten, we've put stuff in place, you know, threaten, you know, then we send the invoice about like, cause you know, you have, there's a limit to how much you can charge, you know, in terms of interest and all that.
[00:44:20] sindbad ambushed.tv: So we do send these invoices that they usually ignore.
[00:44:23] sindbad ambushed.tv: It is a bit of a nightmare.
[00:44:24] sindbad ambushed.tv: I mean, one thing we could do, like I know my dad has a business and he doesn't, but I think it's really hard.
[00:44:29] sindbad ambushed.tv: That's really ballsy, but he gets paid before delivering.
[00:44:33] sindbad ambushed.tv: And I think that is great.
[00:44:35] sindbad ambushed.tv: But like, honestly, I, in our business, just goes so fast.
[00:44:38] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, I think they would probably not go, that's probably not implementable, but anyway.
[00:44:43] Sway Clarke: I think the thing is, you know, I don't know all of the, I know the business that you're in because I've like worked in, like, I mean, as an artist, I've worked with artists.
[00:44:52] Sway Clarke: I've also worked with an advertising agency, for, of course.
[00:45:00] Sway Clarke: lot of advertising companies, and between the voice agents and the booking, and then I know the type of people you're working with, and I do get it that people are all very much arty, arty, everybody's like, I just have an expression, and it costs money, this will all cost money time, but I do think that there are things you could tighten up, like the AI thing, really, I think that unchecked, this can get very out of control.
[00:45:30] Sway Clarke: And I don't think that, I got the sense that you're like, yeah, well, you know, and Maddalena also said this, it's a sense of, if we put too much regulation on them, we're going to lose them as a customer, because they're already increasing the money, right, and I think the other side of it is also, if you guys do that great of a job, people know, yo, I'm not going to find the service and the complete service anywhere else, right, and so I just kind of have to deal with what it is,
[00:46:00] Sway Clarke: Because it's a bit of a bluffing game, but I really do believe, I really do believe, like, with the AI thing, I think that you've got to move the risk, move the...
[00:46:13] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, the responsibility, right?
[00:46:15] sindbad ambushed.tv: hang on to...
[00:46:18] sindbad ambushed.tv: Oh, sorry.
[00:46:19] Sway Clarke: You've got to move the risk.
[00:46:20] Sway Clarke: Oh, yeah.
[00:46:21] Sway Clarke: The risk right now is on you.
[00:46:22] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:23] Sway Clarke: The risk is like, the producer's like, I don't know, this is all the money.
[00:46:27] Sway Clarke: The risk is more like, look, AI, we are only going to pay up to 500 euros per project on any AI generation.
[00:46:39] Sway Clarke: That's it.
[00:46:40] Sway Clarke: That's your budget.
[00:46:41] Sway Clarke: If you work within that, anything outside of that will be on top of your bill.
[00:46:47] Sway Clarke: And what it does, the thing is, I mean, sorry to...
[00:46:51] Sway Clarke: No, you're right.
[00:46:51] Sway Clarke: The thing that what it does is it just psychologically puts someone else in the place that's like, hold on, how much is the...
[00:47:06] sindbad ambushed.tv: The client, because the one thing, sorry, and I, yeah, if it's the client, they might, the problem with that is that they might be, no, no, no, for this project, we don't need the IRO.
[00:47:18] sindbad ambushed.tv: And then in the middle of the, this is the problem because the client is like, no, no, no, let's not pay.
[00:47:23] sindbad ambushed.tv: Because then they would be like, just take it out.
[00:47:25] sindbad ambushed.tv: If it's so much, take it out.
[00:47:27] sindbad ambushed.tv: Because there's a way to build the treatment with Without the, you know, without AI.
[00:47:32] sindbad ambushed.tv: But then in the middle, of course, the suddenly, because that's the thing, like, what sometimes AI saves can save two hours to visual researcher, because instead of researching the image that he needs, he's gonna just create it.
[00:47:45] sindbad ambushed.tv: And so he can't save us time.
[00:47:47] sindbad ambushed.tv: So it's this weird thing is, it's a little bit tricky, because at the same, you want to charge the client, because we've thought about it, you know, like, giving it as an option.
[00:47:55] sindbad ambushed.tv: And maybe it's an option that as soon as they get asked for one generation, then And
[00:48:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: They have to start paying that extra bit, but I mean, the other thing is to, I don't know, sorry, if that's what you, because I wasn't sure if you put the risk on the client, or the only thing you could do is put it on the, because it's the visual researcher that also does the generations and say, here's your budget, don't go over these credits, because otherwise we'll take it off your pace.
[00:48:22] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's a bit mean, but it's another way of doing it, right?
[00:48:26] Sway Clarke: Oh, the researcher is your person, right?
[00:48:28] Sway Clarke: Sorry?
[00:48:28] Sway Clarke: Visual researcher is your person, and the problem with this is that I think the visual researcher also doesn't have much power in this whole scenario, like their power level versus the producer, production company versus the director is probably pretty small, right, and so I think that the reason, it's not even transferring, it's spreading the risk, you're going to always have a risk that with any project, you're going to pay, let's just take an arbitrary number of 500 euros, that's how much we're going to pay.
[00:48:57] Sway Clarke: If you guys go over that, then you.
[00:49:00] Sway Clarke: You pay.
[00:49:00] Sway Clarke: The production company, you will have to pay that difference, and we'll just put it onto your bill.
[00:49:04] sindbad ambushed.tv: The risk always is, and this is where it gets so, sorry, I don't want to be, because I agree generally, but the problem is like they could go and say, listen, like, that was really, you did a bad job on this.
[00:49:18] sindbad ambushed.tv: So, of course, you're spending more because you don't know how to, you know what mean?
[00:49:20] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, that is what worries me, and maybe I'm wrong.
[00:49:23] sindbad ambushed.tv: But, you know, it's like, oh, you've used those credits because you haven't done your generations properly.
[00:49:28] sindbad ambushed.tv: If you'd been spot on straight away, then you wouldn't have, do you know what mean?
[00:49:32] sindbad ambushed.tv: Like, it could be.
[00:49:33] Sway Clarke: Yes, and I think this is where, but this is where the risk, this is where it comes back to you as a company that's saying, if we're going to offer this service, we got to make sure we're offering the service and we're tight about it.
[00:49:48] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah.
[00:49:48] sindbad ambushed.tv: You know what mean?
[00:49:49] Sway Clarke: Like, if you're going to offer somebody to do image generation, then you've got to be able to say, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:49:55] Sway Clarke: So this guy knows exactly what he's doing when it comes to prompts.
[00:49:59] Sway Clarke: So this has nothing to do.
[00:50:00] Sway Clarke: This has to do with the fact that you've changed your mind 7,000 times and you have no direction.
[00:50:05] Sway Clarke: So you have to be able to back that up and say, we're going to offer this service and we know we're going to offer it like this because we know we're dope.
[00:50:12] Sway Clarke: We know that we know what the  we're talking about.
[00:50:14] Sway Clarke: And so when you spread that risk, the risk then goes over to the production company.
[00:50:20] Sway Clarke: And I personally think that once you give, AI is like a drug.
[00:50:26] Sway Clarke: Once a production company knows that it's there and they've used it before, they're not going to tell you they're not going to use it.
[00:50:31] Sway Clarke: Because they know they're going to get faster turnaround times.
[00:50:35] Sway Clarke: They know it's going to speed.
[00:50:36] Sway Clarke: What's the alternative?
[00:50:37] Sway Clarke: Oh, let's go back to not using it.
[00:50:39] sindbad ambushed.tv: And we know what not using it's like.
[00:50:42] Sway Clarke: So you have to kind of push it back to them and be like, hey, we can not use it.
[00:50:46] Sway Clarke: That may be two or three more hours.
[00:50:48] Sway Clarke: That's but you're going to pay for that anyway, right?
[00:50:51] Sway Clarke: So you're going to pay for something.
[00:50:53] Sway Clarke: But what we need to do is we got to make sure that somebody reigns in this  director or whoever it is.
[00:51:00] Sway Clarke: And that's the truth of it.
[00:51:01] Sway Clarke: I think that you can't take on all the risk.
[00:51:05] Sway Clarke: I think being very nice and taking on a lot of risks with like over hours and trusting your employees and giving all of this space and you're giving a lot of people like, if you want to go over, just give me a call in the middle of the night and then changing things up.
[00:51:19] Sway Clarke: Like you're already doing that.
[00:51:20] Sway Clarke: And these companies know that.
[00:51:22] Sway Clarke: But you're like, look, we're going to offer this service, but this is our stipulation with it.
[00:51:26] Sway Clarke: We know that this thing can get out of control.
[00:51:29] Sway Clarke: So we got to cap it.
[00:51:31] Sway Clarke: And any company does this, any service.
[00:51:34] Sway Clarke: ChatGPT is like, you're going to pay me $20 a month.
[00:51:37] Sway Clarke: This is how much time you're going to get.
[00:51:39] Sway Clarke: After that, you're Right.
[00:51:42] Sway Clarke: And I think that's okay to say, we're going to do, we're going to offer a service, but we're going to offer it on a credit basis.
[00:51:48] Sway Clarke: We're going to give everybody 500 euros worth of time.
[00:51:51] Sway Clarke: And once it's done, then the cost is going to go to the production company.
[00:51:55] sindbad ambushed.tv: It's true that if we're getting, sorry, I'm just, thank you for this really help.
[00:52:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: But if we get a really good deal because we have a business deal with whatever, let's imagine like a million credit.
[00:52:06] sindbad ambushed.tv: I can't remember what it was on this CREA thing.
[00:52:09] sindbad ambushed.tv: So, for example, sorry, I'll just shoot because what I'm thinking is if we're getting a super good rate on the credit, then we can offer them what appears to be a lot of credit for a decent, for fairly, maybe I'm wrong about that because you might know better about this thing.
[00:52:26] sindbad ambushed.tv: But, you know, like basically imagine, so I was looking at pricing business, you know, and like you can go and like imagine if that's what we're spending every month, let's imagine, like 1.5 million credits, maybe that's a really good deal.
[00:52:41] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't know.
[00:52:42] sindbad ambushed.tv: I haven't made the calculation.
[00:52:43] sindbad ambushed.tv: But in other words, if we talk instead of talking about money, we're like you get so many credits on this.
[00:52:50] sindbad ambushed.tv: I don't know how it works.
[00:52:51] sindbad ambushed.tv: Do they use the term credits?
[00:52:52] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, so it uses here to compute units per month.
[00:52:59] sindbad ambushed.tv: How many credits?
[00:53:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: And in other words, we can maybe offer them something that appears very generous and actually doesn't cost us that much, know what I mean?
[00:53:10] sindbad ambushed.tv: 100%.
[00:53:11] Sway Clarke: I think the best thing to do would be to, I don't know if there's any way to do this, is there any way for you to look back at what you've used in the last couple of months and look at the credits used, be able to compute it, and you can then say, okay, if we get a million credits a month, we more than cover the costs.
[00:53:29] Sway Clarke: And then you can say to every project, you look, I mean, let's say you get 10 projects a month or 15 or maybe even 20.
[00:53:39] Sway Clarke: You could say, look, if you know, okay, how do I say this?
[00:53:42] Sway Clarke: If you know that out of 20 projects that you get a month, only like three or four people are really going to burn through all of these credits, right?
[00:53:51] Sway Clarke: But you know that in the last couple of months, you've never went over a million, right?
[00:53:55] Sway Clarke: Then you get the 1.5 million and you...
[00:54:00] Sway Clarke: Share the cost amongst all of your people.
[00:54:02] Sway Clarke: say, look, for a hundred euros for this project, we're going to charge you a hundred euros.
[00:54:07] Sway Clarke: You get unlimited.
[00:54:08] Sway Clarke: You get as much as you want to use, but you see what I mean?
[00:54:11] Sway Clarke: And you know that with, with 10 or 20 projects, that 20 is going to cover your 2,000 you just paid.
[00:54:19] Sway Clarke: You just showed me, and they're going to get all of the credits.
[00:54:22] Sway Clarke: Now it's going to balance out because some people are going to go apeshit.
[00:54:25] Sway Clarke: Some people use practically none.
[00:54:27] Sway Clarke: Exactly.
[00:54:28] Sway Clarke: Yeah.
[00:54:28] sindbad ambushed.tv: Nice.
[00:54:29] sindbad ambushed.tv: And that may be a way to do it.
[00:54:31] Sway Clarke: You just, or you just, you just put the price in there.
[00:54:33] Sway Clarke: You say, look, for an extra 150 a month or for one, actually what we're going to offer is a service that says, we'll do all of the prompting.
[00:54:41] Sway Clarke: We'll do all of the credit.
[00:54:42] Sway Clarke: It's just 150 flat.
[00:54:44] Sway Clarke: And you can calculate in your head when we get this many projects per month, we cover the cost of the Korea subscription for a month.
[00:54:51] sindbad ambushed.tv: You're golden.
[00:54:52] sindbad ambushed.tv: Right?
[00:54:53] sindbad ambushed.tv: No, no, no.
[00:54:53] sindbad ambushed.tv: That's a good point.
[00:54:54] sindbad ambushed.tv: I think that's a, that's a really interesting way of doing it.
[00:54:57] sindbad ambushed.tv: And yeah, we can experiment the first month with that.
[00:54:59] sindbad ambushed.tv: half lot.
[00:54:59] sindbad ambushed.tv: we got...
[00:55:00] sindbad ambushed.tv: Yeah, but it's important to monitor as well how it's used.
[00:55:04] Sway Clarke: Yeah, you've got to go back and look at the usage for the last two months.
[00:55:07] Sway Clarke: And that will tell you even if you say, well, we were at 3 million.
[00:55:11] Sway Clarke: I don't know if that's crazy.
[00:55:12] Sway Clarke: We were at 3 million or something.
[00:55:14] Sway Clarke: Then you're looking to say, okay, we're going to take this 1.5 million.
[00:55:18] Sway Clarke: We're going to pay for it.
[00:55:20] Sway Clarke: We're going to tell everybody, look, 100 bucks.
[00:55:23] Sway Clarke: Yeah, 100 euros a month is how much you're going to get.
[00:55:28] Sway Clarke: And there's a but there is a limit of like 5,000 credits or something or 10,000 credits or something like this.
[00:55:35] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:55:36] Sway Clarke: And you can give people a buffer, but you could also get them to pay a small fee and you balance it out.
[00:55:41] Sway Clarke: Right.
[00:55:41] Sway Clarke: There's a way to do this.
[00:55:43] Sway Clarke: And I have to tell you, it's not crazy to people if this is not like, I think people understand that burning credits is a thing and they understand how much this costs.
[00:55:55] Sway Clarke: And you're like, look, I'm offering you this service.
[00:55:57] Sway Clarke: Yeah, there's a cost for it.
[00:55:59] Sway Clarke: And I mean, Thank you.
[00:56:00] Sway Clarke: No, no, I think you're right.
[00:56:01] Sway Clarke: People know this.
[00:56:03] Sway Clarke: They don't know, like, it's like in the music, like in the sound, in the vocal industry that I was in, no advertising agency in their right mind thought, ah, we can now use 11 labs to create voices for free.
[00:56:19] Sway Clarke: Nobody thought that.
[00:56:21] sindbad ambushed.tv: Nobody thought that.
[00:56:22] Sway Clarke: So image generation is not free either.
[00:56:24] Sway Clarke: You're like, look, this is what the cost is and this is the rate for it.
[00:56:28] Sway Clarke: You pick your package.
