work from home, or do you?","timestamp":"00:13:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, no, no, she's got a more traditional

you to know, at quarter to one, I need to go because I have another meeting, but we still have half an hour, which is, but yeah, no, just to go on this subject, I think, yeah, like we, I think I told you, you know, I know how you feel about Germany, but Stuttgart, with all its faults, what I quite liked, actually, is you meet people who may have like a slightly boring job, or sometimes completely boring job, but like they have passions outside, and like their life is, I don't know, they're not so ambitious, but it's a good thing, it's like they're doing things for the pleasure of doing things, you know, like some are musicians, some are painters, honestly, some of the painters that I know, like, I really don't like what they do, like, but it doesn't matter, like they are, they are, you

know, if she's not so bothered to have a job that's not like super, you know, interesting, or, I don't know, or maybe it is interesting, but in a different way, then, then, then you can make your plan

just ambition, it's like, it's interesting, it's intellectual, you know what I mean, like, it's, yeah.","timestamp":"00:15:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"I get it too, right?","timestamp":"00:15:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, she's probably all, and she loves it, it's just something that's, I've worked my life here, and now I've got this, I don't want just leave that thing.","timestamp":"00:15:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, exactly.","timestamp":"00:15:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Anyway, we'll, we'll work things out, but yeah, so nice to, to, you know, connect with you, and I, and I'll breathe.","timestamp":"00:15:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Briefly, because you might tell me, actually, this is, I can't really help you, because I was thinking, know, what do I need help with, currently, in terms of AI, and why don't we cover this, because maybe very quickly you'll tell me, oh, I don't know, it's going to be tricky, and then we can go back to chatting about other things, if need, you know, if we have time.","timestamp":"00:16:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But, yeah, no, basically, I was trying to think, you know, because, I mean, it's super interesting what you're proposing, and I was discussing, and, you know, I've got a cousin who's, you know, I've heard about these things where you can just go on your own and, like, basically explain what you need, like, the little things that were, so, okay, there's two tasks that I thought, and maybe there will be more in the future, but two tasks that I thought, I have two businesses, by the way.","timestamp":"00:16:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"They have Bold Move, which does film and television, pitch decks, and before that, I started another business, which does the same thing, but for advertising competition, so, people who make TV commercials, they always compete with one another, the directors, and we support them, so, it's a similar thing.","timestamp":"00:16:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"We created these crazy presentations, super immersive, but for advertising, and that's a bigger business, because advertising is nonstop, like a company might pitch five times a month or something, whereas TV and film, it's a lot slower, the business, boldmove, is a lot smaller.","timestamp":"00:17:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So yeah, the other one is really paying my bills, boldmove at the moment, not at all.","timestamp":"00:17:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, no, no, the other one is called Ambushed.","timestamp":"00:17:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So Ambushed, which is the other company, which is on LinkedIn, I read it on LinkedIn.","timestamp":"00:17:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, yeah, exactly.","timestamp":"00:17:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So that one is the one that really pays my bills, even though I think we've made some slightly, you know, I was going to say boldmove, like we took a risk, like we basically reinforced the core team, like we have a lot of like, like we have a super great support team, but it's also more expensive, meaning it's quite expensive.","timestamp":"00:17:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So meaning now we have this pressure of like, unless we go over a certain turnover.","timestamp":"00:17:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Then we start losing money.","timestamp":"00:18:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"yeah, we had to increase prices.","timestamp":"00:18:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"It's kind of this moment where like...","timestamp":"00:18:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"How many people are in each business?","timestamp":"00:18:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"How big are the businesses?","timestamp":"00:18:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So boldmove is just me with one employee full-time, one employee part-time.","timestamp":"00:18:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So we're only three really.","timestamp":"00:18:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"There are other collaborators.","timestamp":"00:18:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Of course, we have a lot of freelancers.","timestamp":"00:18:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So all those people are freelancers?","timestamp":"00:18:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah.","timestamp":"00:18:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Well, this thing we haven't completely updated.","timestamp":"00:18:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So out of the...","timestamp":"00:18:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Actually, yeah, it's like, you know how websites are like, updating it takes a while.","timestamp":"00:18:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So really now, there's a couple of those people are freelancers.","timestamp":"00:18:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And then the other ones are...","timestamp":"00:18:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Yeah, it changed a little bit.","timestamp":"00:18:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So I think we need to update at some point.","timestamp":"00:18:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But yeah, let's say we're three full-time.","timestamp":"00:18:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Well, not full-time.","timestamp":"00:18:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"We're going to have full-time with boldmove.","timestamp":"00:18:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Although I can't say I'm completely full-time because I'm also working on screenplays.","timestamp":"00:18:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"I work as a writer and I also work for Ambush.","timestamp":"00:18:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So for me, it's like, so...","timestamp":"00:18:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But that's boldmove.","timestamp":"00:19:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"The Ambush is very different.","timestamp":"00:19:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Ambush, we have eight people full-time.","timestamp":"00:19:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:19:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Hang on.","timestamp":"00:19:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Three plus four.","timestamp":"00:19:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"yeah, sorry.","timestamp":"00:19:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Seven plus two.","timestamp":"00:19:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"We are nine if you count me and my business partner.","timestamp":"00:19:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And so this one is, yeah, it's quite, and we work with like maybe 70, 80 freelancers, and we have 50 pitches per month roughly on average, right?","timestamp":"00:19:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, yeah, 40.","timestamp":"00:19:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Yeah, so it's, that's big, you know, that is big.","timestamp":"00:19:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But, yeah, it's currently, to keep that structure, we better do a lot of, yeah.","timestamp":"00:19:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Like, we're not, we don't, so we don't really do sales for Ambush because it's really word of mouth.","timestamp":"00:19:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And if anything, we, sometimes, we were not able to meet the demand, like, you know.","timestamp":"00:19:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So, yeah, so it's good, it's good.","timestamp":"00:19:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"We're in a good position, except that I just, you know, I'm a bit nervous that the price raise was a bit, we'll see, we'll see.","timestamp":"00:19:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"This is a, these weeks are going to.","timestamp":"00:19:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:19:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But anyway, so yeah, the one thing, so what's happened is with Ambushed, I was thinking, because what I'm doing now is kind of, my business partner I thought would do the finance side of things at first, because he came from a business school, and I knew the business, I was a writer for advertising directors, I did all of that, and he, yeah, when I brought him in I realized he did a lot of good things, but really he's not meticulous, so I ended up, by, yeah, by, what do you call it, default, or, you know, to, I ended up being the person who does all of the payments, and it's, it feels a little bit like, you know, boring, and it is boring, and also it's super repetitive, so we have a team, an admin team, that will, I'll show you a little bit, that will do stuff like, you know, we have a dashboard, so every project, you know,","timestamp":"00:20:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Like, we put basically the hours of that person, know, you have their rate, and then in the end, you get a percentage of, you know, and then, you know, so we keep track of all of that.","timestamp":"00:21:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Of course, at the bottom, you've got, like, turnover for the month.","timestamp":"00:21:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So we have this monthly, as you can see, you know, every month is a new tab.","timestamp":"00:21:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"We put here, you know, everyone's rates, et cetera.","timestamp":"00:21:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So we have that, and then I, what I do is every week, actually, which is also quite time-consuming, but the reason I do it every week is I realized we had cash flow problems.","timestamp":"00:21:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So if I did it, what do you call it, sorry, if I did it monthly or two, or by week, by or twice a month, we sometimes would be, have problems with cash flow.","timestamp":"00:21:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Whereas when I do it every week, because cash is coming in at, you know, gradually, then somehow I, that's the solution for, but what it.","timestamp":"00:21:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"It means also it's more admin for me.","timestamp":"00:22:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So basically what I do is very, you know, which is really quite boring, is like, okay, I open an invoice, I've got a map amount, I know what, you know, I know the project, and I just, I'm very, like, I just don't like to, I don't think I should, you know, I wanna be very, make sure everything's fine, and to be honest, most of the time it is, but you know, okay, Oliver, how many hours I look, oh, see, this was not, normally the admin team would have entered, but I guess it's quite recent, anyway.","timestamp":"00:22:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But yeah, let's say it was someone else, I would check the amount of hours, check the rate, make sure it, you know, works, and then manually pay each invoice.","timestamp":"00:22:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So that is quite time consuming, and it's something I'm thinking I could, you know, there would be an argument for, you know, like giving, for example, yeah, like, I could ask the admin team to tell me, okay, this week we need to pay, I don't 20,000 euros worth of invoice.","timestamp":"00:22:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And then we could just transfer the sum, and I could ask them to do it, that would be one solution, but what I quite like, and maybe makes me a little bit , but I quite like that there's someone else that checks, that everything checks out, rather than the same person who was supposed to put the number in, because I think they might do shortcuts, and occasionally, oh, there's a project that wasn't even put in the dashboard, therefore it wasn't going to be invoice.","timestamp":"00:23:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"to the clients, it happened a couple of times, or the rates that match up, there's a crazy amount of hours, like why did this guy work so many hours, can we check what happened with the client on this project, it doesn't make sense, or whatever.","timestamp":"00:23:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So, you know, occasionally I pick up something, it's not a lot, it's like, I would say 90% of the time, everything checks out, and I do spend a day a week, maybe, yeah, maybe not quite a day, but, you know, probably like five, six hours every week, which, if I could somehow, out.","timestamp":"00:23:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, I,","timestamp":"00:23:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's 18 to 20 hours a month.","timestamp":"00:24:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Exactly.","timestamp":"00:24:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So I think that that is something that I think, you know, but I would, but if I was automating it or like using help, getting the help of AI, by the way, I was opening it because it's going to be, I think we'll have, I'm using wise, but I did check.","timestamp":"00:24:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And let me show you.","timestamp":"00:24:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"I think there are ways to, sorry, there's something else.","timestamp":"00:24:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Excuse me.","timestamp":"00:24:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Is it this?","timestamp":"00:24:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:24:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So there's a way to do batch payments.","timestamp":"00:24:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So I think that, you know, there would be a way for, again, batch payment, but I wouldn't want to do a batch payment before I've checked everything.","timestamp":"00:24:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But if AI could check things and, you know, tell me if there was a discrepancy, but it, you know, it could be a little bit tricky to, yeah.","timestamp":"00:24:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So anyway, that's one, before we get into, I was just going to say, so that's one thing, and then I'll show you the other thing and then you can.","timestamp":"00:24:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"can tell me your thoughts.","timestamp":"00:25:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And the other thing is for boldmove, is...","timestamp":"00:25:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Oh, boldmove, I just want to, I just want to...","timestamp":"00:25:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Oh yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah, please.","timestamp":"00:25:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So with the first one, it's with Ambush, particularly.","timestamp":"00:25:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"correct.","timestamp":"00:25:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And you have, so I understand it, you have all of these clients that need to get paid, these freelancers, or other organizations that you're working with.","timestamp":"00:25:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"mostly freelancers, yeah.","timestamp":"00:25:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So we have our clients, you know, here we put like the name of the client, project, client, director, producer, so that's...","timestamp":"00:25:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And I don't do that, like someone else, we have another, we have an invoicing system, and they, the admin team will send the invoice, explain if there's been a bit of overtime or whatever.","timestamp":"00:25:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So that's all been done by someone else.","timestamp":"00:25:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"What my part is, you know, which by the way, if we could, yeah, why not?","timestamp":"00:25:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Like for the organization, if we could make this process, other processes a bit less tedious that could, you know, benefit other members of the team.","timestamp":"00:25:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But in terms of my, my tasks, what, yeah, that's taking me about 20 hours a month, is really paying the finances.","timestamp":"00:25:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"That's the...","timestamp":"00:25:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Because I just don't feel super comfortable, and I know I could create an account within our WISE account for, as I was saying earlier, there would be maybe a way to ask someone else to do it, but currently I've just been doing it, and it does make me feel in control, I guess, that I'm doing it, you know?","timestamp":"00:26:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, well, I mean, the thing is, you know, whenever you're talking about these processes, it doesn't have to be an all or nothing.","timestamp":"00:26:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"doesn't have to be a Sindbad is in the process, or he's not in the process at all, and it's automated, right?","timestamp":"00:26:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You can always add in like a human checkpoint that says, I just want to see that this is correct, and then it says there's nothing wrong, and I press go, and then it goes off again, right?","timestamp":"00:26:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So just so you know, you can put humans in any loop, but just so I understand it, what's happening right now is you are doing the final checks for all of this invoicing administration.","timestamp":"00:26:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Exactly.","timestamp":"00:26:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Not invoicing.","timestamp":"00:26:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

three.","timestamp":"00:29:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So I will check, and then I'll make one

doing my personal stuff, you know, like, I don't think personal, it's still, you know, but yeah, it's a good, it's a good point, like, it would be really good to save that time.","timestamp":"00:30:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And that's just between me and you.","timestamp":"00:30:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"The sad thing about Ambush is, my business partner and I, like,

think there's a lot of, it's, this is why I started actually Boldmove, because initially Boldmove was a section of Ambush.","timestamp":"00:30:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And then when things got a little bit like he wanted to do his own thing, like AI, like he wanted to do, you know, like create images, with AI, you know, basically, you want to","timestamp":"00:30:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"He started his own

business.","timestamp":"00:31:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So I said to him, okay, you know, it took me a while.","timestamp":"00:31:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"I was pretty angry at first, and then I said, okay, I'm going to start a separate company, which is boldmove, and that way I'm putting my efforts.","timestamp":"00:31:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And, you know, currently I would say, now a little bit less so because I've taken, you know, as I said, like one and a half, well, yeah, I've taken two people, one full-time, one part-time for boldmove.","timestamp":"00:31:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But like I would say before, it was like 90% effort for boldmove, 10% revenue versus, you know, 10% effort for ambush and 90% revenue.","timestamp":"00:31:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So, yeah, it's been like this.","timestamp":"00:31:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But, yeah, no, I mean, I'm developing, you know, creative

Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"At some point I realized I would prefer, and it's sad to say this, know, because there's no way of buying each other out, we don't have the money to buy each other out, so I would almost prefer that he did like the bare minimum.","timestamp":"00:32:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So what he does, he does recruitment, which I'm grateful for because like you will meet a new person and like, you know, basically just tell them the same thing over and over about the company and I'm really quite happy I don't have to do that.","timestamp":"00:32:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad

developing boldmove because in the long run, I, yeah, Ambushed is, yeah, it's like my partner who is not someone I really want to develop things with, you know, so even though it has a potential, I definitely want to put my, and I'm actually, I'm in the process, which actually for that one, I could really, really use some help probably at some point, we, we're, we start, I've got an idea

sort of, you know, BBC style interviews, super, like, you know, and interview them about their life, you know, ask them questions about, you know, yeah, like life, their life, but also generally, you

at some point we can, know if it's ready, but like, kind of get rid of all the bits that are, you know, when someone goes to the toilet or whatever, like, so make it clean, take it, you know, editing out everything that's not good, that doesn't, you know, and, but have maybe, have this processed in a way that is automated, not, I don't know, to make it, and then basically, put it online, and also have a, like, an automated transcript of what they're saying, which means that, let's imagine, it's two hour long interview, and you're like, oh yeah, I want to see what granny said about, you

Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So yeah, let me talk quick, so shall I talk briefly about the other thing, which is, uh, it's another issue.","timestamp":"00:36:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Let me show you.","timestamp":"00:36:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Uh, so for, for boldmove, like.","timestamp":"00:36:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"We get some time, what do you call it, let me see, what do I, yeah, so we get requests, and then people are interested, then we send maybe the prices, and maybe they thought it was cheaper, or they don't say that, you kind of disappear, you know, and we thought, okay, it would be good to have, and we started, you know, like we called it the request tracker, right, so, yeah, this is what happened, this is, you know, and then basically, waiting on clients, ghosted, you know, canceled, whatever.","timestamp":"00:37:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So we have all these little, so that's just a quick template we've put together, but we can, you know, improve it, but the idea, my idea, and again, is that, how easy is that, would be to allow AI to go through my emails, and be like, okay, what was this, okay, this is actually someone looking for work, fine, but, you know, we, and then basically kind of have this thing where I could, I mean, I know I can look up, but like, I mean, okay, maybe that, maybe that's,","timestamp":"00:37:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"That example, because it's someone who wants to be employed, but there is basically the other day, and I've got it on the comment, but I went through all of the emails and found all of the leads that we had that didn't turn into a project, right?","timestamp":"00:38:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And we were thinking it's easier to go back to someone who showed an interest at some point than go on a cold call, right?","timestamp":"00:38:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So I think it's a useful thing to do.","timestamp":"00:38:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"It is quite, again, a little bit, I mean, it's not impossible, it is, but if it was automated, all the better, right?","timestamp":"00:38:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"I mean, it's something we can do, but it's one of those things where you're like, I should do this, and then you never really, I don't know, it seems like, okay, it's not that important, but actually, you know, when you're like, okay, I want to, you know, contact an old client, and also, I think it can provide interesting data about, okay, when, maybe now I'm going a little bit too deep, but like, you know, when did the conversation stop?","timestamp":"00:38:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Did we say something?","timestamp":"00:38:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Something that maybe was wrong, know, made them, you know, so then we can maybe polish and improve the way, you know, because sometimes people go, oh yeah, I'm interested.","timestamp":"00:39:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And then, so for example, I also approach people on LinkedIn sometimes.","timestamp":"00:39:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And, you know, I don't know, I do this thing where I'm like, okay, do you know, if you have 10 minutes, let's go on a quick call, you know, it's like, it's only going to take you 10 minutes.","timestamp":"00:39:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And still, that doesn't always work.","timestamp":"00:39:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So, you know, maybe we could be like, okay, that 10 minutes call to action to have a quick meet, that doesn't work, but maybe something else works.","timestamp":"00:39:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Maybe we should do a calendly, you know, calendar or whatever it is, like, you know, to improve basically the way, because we, we, we're ambushed, you know, is, as I said, word of mouth, people come, you know, on their own, and we don't really have to sell.","timestamp":"00:39:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Boldmove is the opposite.","timestamp":"00:39:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"It's like, we do great work, but I think we need to get known better.","timestamp":"00:39:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"We were, so yeah, I mean, we've just updated.","timestamp":"00:39:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"I know you said, and thank you, you said you like the website.","timestamp":"00:39:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"We've just updated, but know, it's not enough.","timestamp":"00:39:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Like, like, uh, for example, in the way.","timestamp":"00:39:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Now, have some new examples that we've put, you know, all these are new, this is a great tech, for example, and so this also, so yeah, we do these things, we just basically pretty crap at selling, you know, like, you know, you're talking about outbound leads, you basically, well, two things I hear, I hear reactivation, because you're like, how can we reactivate old leads that are warm that we're supposed to, and then how do we generate new leads?","timestamp":"00:40:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Exactly, and that is a big subject, yeah, because I think we're, so at the moment, I'm working, as I said, I'm working with a guy who's kind of running the operation when projects are on, and he's great, and, you know, but then there's another guy who is also, it's kind of weird, but like, he's a writer, he often contributes to project as a writer, but he also does a little bit of admin for me, and also a little bit of sales, but he, but so far, he's proven, he's just not, you know,","timestamp":"00:40:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"I mean, so far he's just didn't have, I think he managed to get one meeting in three months, you know, like that is the level of, and I don't blame him, I'm just as bad, so, and, you know, I guess it's like, I should have maybe chosen someone who's got a sales profile, but I really can't afford it, you know, so he's not, like, he's, you know, he's doing a few hours, like, it's not like he's full time on that, but still, yeah, I think, but I mean, that's a difference, I guess that's not your expertise, you know, like, there's a difference here, mean, yeah, we definitely have to have another call.","timestamp":"00:41:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So, I think I'll send you a link after, and we'll book another call pretty quick.","timestamp":"00:41:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That'd be great, yeah, yeah.","timestamp":"00:41:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"There's a couple things that I'm hearing, it's like, you know, there are building, like, one of the things we do do is we build lead generation systems for companies, right, or we will build a, like you're talking about, a reactivation system for companies.","timestamp":"00:41:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"This is a thing that you can look at, you can look at, I want to make more money, I want to cut costs.","timestamp":"00:41:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Those are the two main things, right?","timestamp":"00:41:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And with Amber,","timestamp":"00:41:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's like, I want to cut costs so I can make more money, because if I can cut these five or six hours out, I could use it to strategize, I could use it to do things to generate more money for the company.","timestamp":"00:42:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Exactly.","timestamp":"00:42:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's true.","timestamp":"00:42:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, completely.","timestamp":"00:42:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's like an administrative problem that you're like, hey, I would cut this down.","timestamp":"00:42:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And what I would say with that is, I would like to talk with your administrators, because I think it's, I would like to understand the full system before saying, this is what we're going to build here for this.","timestamp":"00:42:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"To be like, the people who are actually putting the information there, I'd like to understand their problem.","timestamp":"00:42:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"like, they might be something totally different, like, actually, the system, right?","timestamp":"00:42:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You know, so I would need to talk with somebody in that move.","timestamp":"00:42:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"With all the move, the interesting thing about the new leads or reactivating leads, it is doable.","timestamp":"00:42:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I think the question becomes, and this is for you, it's like, how do to綽 ‫ST laugh kotzt kotzt kotzt","timestamp":"00:42:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So, reactivating leads, how many leads do you actually reactivate per month and per year, right?","timestamp":"00:43:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That would be a question because it's like, do you need to build a system for that?","timestamp":"00:43:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, is it worth it?","timestamp":"00:43:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So for me, just so you know, in my mind, was more having the data, not automating emails because I think, I don't want to get on people's nerves, you know, like I think that's always a risk.","timestamp":"00:43:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So I think it has to be done very tactfully, I think.","timestamp":"00:43:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"But, yeah, and you know, to be honest, we've been asking ourselves so many questions, know, do we need to do a newsletter, you know, so many people do think, and I do, I mean, as a, let's say consumer, if you want to use that term, like I don't really like to be bombarded with, you know, with like newsletters and things like that.","timestamp":"00:43:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"I know it probably works, but it's still, I don't know.","timestamp":"00:43:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So, and also it is a lot of time to create content.","timestamp":"00:43:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"So, sorry, that's maybe again, a bit outside of your, but yeah, there's definitely a need for a strategy.","timestamp":"00:43:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"And I.","timestamp":"00:43:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"I don't know if, like, maybe I need to work out my strategy first before asking your help, because otherwise it's like I'm asking you to be a sales advisor, you know, that's a bit different.","timestamp":"00:44:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's two things.","timestamp":"00:44:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What I do is I'm not, I mean, a bit about Aloxone, I know you don't have time, you've got to run.","timestamp":"00:44:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I can take two minutes and then, yeah.","timestamp":"00:44:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What I am is I am like an AI transformation partner.","timestamp":"00:44:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's how I build it, right?","timestamp":"00:44:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And it's not that, hey, what do you need built?","timestamp":"00:44:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'm going to build that thing for you.","timestamp":"00:44:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's about me coming in as a partner to help you figure out where the problems are, figure out what you need to build, figure out how feasible it is to you need to build it, figure out whether you need to build it at all, whether it even makes sense.","timestamp":"00:44:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Sometimes it's about a process, like actually building a standard operating system first and then automating something, and then kind of helping you through this process.","timestamp":"00:44:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because what it is, is that you're like, like very many businesses I work with, it's like, I've got all these things that I need to do, and I don't know how.","timestamp":"00:44:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I don't even know where AI starts, where it ends, what is doable, what is not doable, and my job is to, A, come in and find out what's the real problem, where are the real issues, what are the real bottlenecks, and talk about those things, and then find out and decide with you, maybe the value is doing something over here better than over here, you know, maybe it's actually working on this right now first before we work on this right now, you know what I mean?","timestamp":"00:45:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So, I think with boldmove, I think doing outbound lead generation is always important, because I mean, once you, the thing is, there's a common problem in businesses, I want to cut down these costs and free up all this time, and then the question is, well, do you have a lead generation machine to get more leads, what do you do with this?","timestamp":"00:45:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And it's kind of the chicken and the egg, well, if I get more leads, I don't have the time to nurture them because I have all these things to do, right?","timestamp":"00:45:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So, these are the things that we've kind of got to work with, if we work together.","timestamp":"00:45:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.","timestamp":"00:45:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I think lead generation is good.","timestamp":"00:45:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I understand your concern of like, I don't want to bother people, but there's another side of it that's like, you got to be present.","timestamp":"00:46:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You got to be out there.","timestamp":"00:46:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And the question then becomes how?","timestamp":"00:46:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Maybe it's like a machine that like goes on Instagram and finds contacts for you.","timestamp":"00:46:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"People that are maybe producing films that are interested in pitch decks on LinkedIn and finding these people for you that you can contact them.","timestamp":"00:46:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Maybe it doesn't do the automation, but there's different ways.","timestamp":"00:46:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"There's look at it, right?","timestamp":"00:46:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Yeah, it would be super interesting to do the next call, but with Richard who's helping me on that as well, because he's been on the ground doing it.","timestamp":"00:46:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"How do we, sorry, and at some point, and I mean, sorry, because we're running out of time, but I wanted to ask you as well, how do you get paid?","timestamp":"00:46:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@boldmove.tv"},"text":"Of course, like that's quite an important question.","timestamp":"00:46:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We would have to look at the scope of the problem.","timestamp":"00:47:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

thing?","timestamp":"00:47:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And what I technically like to do is more based off of like value, right?","timestamp":"00:47:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's so, there are two different things.","timestamp":"00:47:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The one is the administrative thing, which is basically, okay, if this is a system that I'm building and this is the scope of it, and it's, this is how it's built, you could, I could easily just say, well, this is the time it takes to build this thing.","timestamp":"00:47:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"This is the cost of
