# SLIDE 1: TITLE
presentation_title: "Discovery Summary & Discussion"
client_company: "Ambush TV"
presenter_name: "Sway Clarke"
presentation_date: "January 2026"

# SLIDE 2: HOW WE GOT HERE
context_timeline: "Over the past two weeks (January 8-15, 2026)"
context_stakeholders: "Sindbad, Leonor, Madalena, and Alice"
context_summary: |
  We explored operational challenges around invoice validation, data
  synchronization across multiple sheets, and project tracking across
  Ambush's 50-project-per-month operation.
context_approach: |
  Today I want to share what we discovered and get your perspective
  on these challenges and potential directions.

# SLIDE 3: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
client_company_description: |
  Ambush TV creates advertising pitch presentations for commercial directors,
  managing 50+ projects monthly with a team of 9 core people and 70-80 freelancers.
client_context_statement: |
  The admin team handles bookings, project tracking, invoicing, and freelancer
  payments across multiple interconnected Google Sheets.

---

# SLIDE 4: WHAT WE DISCOVERED
# Note: Lead with financial impact (€150K), then operational issues

discovery_1: "Outstanding Client Payments"
discovery_1_description: |
  €150,000 in outstanding client payments, with €100,000 overdue by more than
  30 days. Late invoicing (often 1-2 months after project end) and no systematic
  follow-up contributes to slow collection.
discovery_1_impact: "Cash flow impact + awkward late invoice conversations"
discovery_1_source: "Verified with Sindbad (Jan 15)"

discovery_2: "Data Doesn't Flow Between Systems"
discovery_2_description: |
  Information exists in 12+ sheets that don't talk to each other. Names don't
  match across sheets ('Dan Thomas French' vs 'Dan French'), team changes don't
  sync from Calendar to Dashboard, rates require triple-entry. The team described
  spending significant time manually transferring and verifying data.
discovery_2_impact: "5+ hours/week on manual sync and verification across admin team"
discovery_2_source: "Alice, Madalena, Leonor (Jan 15 admin call)"

discovery_3: "Invoice Validation Burden"
discovery_3_description: |
  Sindbad manually validates 15-25 freelancer invoices each week against project
  hours, catching approximately 10% with errors. Each error averages €150 and
  requires investigation and correction.
discovery_3_impact: "22 hours/month of Sindbad's time + error costs"
discovery_3_source: "Verified with Sindbad (Jan 8, Jan 15)"

discovery_4: "Month-End Invoicing Delays"
discovery_4_description: |
  No systematic reminders for project close-out. Projects end, then 1-2 months
  pass before hours are collected and clients are invoiced. December projects
  weren't fully closed until January 12th.
discovery_4_impact: "Delayed cash flow + strained client relationships"
discovery_4_source: "Alice, Madalena (Jan 15 admin call)"

# SLIDE 5: POTENTIAL DIRECTIONS
# Note: Frame as exploration, not commitment

direction_1: "Single Source of Truth Architecture"
direction_1_description: |
  Data entered once, flows everywhere. Calendar to Dashboard to Project Directory
  to Invoicing. Names normalized. Team changes reflect automatically. Edits
  anywhere update everywhere.

direction_2: "Systematic Collection & Visibility"
direction_2_description: |
  Calendar-driven reminders (Day 4: collect hours, Day 7: invoice client). Aging
  dashboard showing who owes what, how long. Freed admin capacity to actually
  chase overdue payments.

direction_3: "Invoice Pre-Validation with Human Checkpoints"
direction_3_description: |
  Automated checks flag potential issues before Sindbad reviews. Dashboard
  validates hours against timesheets. Exceptions surfaced for human decision.
  Reduces validation time while keeping human judgment in the loop.

---

# SLIDE 6: WHAT THIS COULD LOOK LIKE
phase_1_name: "Foundation & Quick Wins"
phase_1_description: |
  Single source of truth setup, rate sync automation, calendar-driven reminders,
  Fathom call recording integration.
phase_1_duration: "4-6 weeks"

phase_2_name: "Invoice Validation System"
phase_2_description: |
  Invoice parsing and pre-validation, hours verification against timesheets,
  exception dashboard, Wise payment preparation.
phase_2_duration: "8-10 weeks"

timeline_caveat: |
  This is a rough outline - actual approach depends on priorities we align on today.

# Framing Notes
framing_notes:
  lead_with: "€150K outstanding as the hook - highest value"
  emphasize: "Data interoperability (not just rate sync) - addresses full scope"
  connect_150k_to:
    - "Freed admin capacity (automation eliminates manual work)"
    - "Systematic reminders (nothing falls through cracks)"
    - "Visibility dashboard (know who owes what, how long)"
  avoid: "Pushing for pricing decision - this is alignment, not close"
