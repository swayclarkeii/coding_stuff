# AI Audit Interview - Leonor Zuzarte (HR & Community Manager)

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Project:** AmbushTV AI Audit
**Role:** Community Manager / HR Coordinator
**Interviewer:** Sway Clarke
**Duration:** ~45 minutes

---

## Role Overview

**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Community support and freelancer relations (core function)
- Onboarding coordination (logistical support for Pierre's interviews)
- Weekly feedback collection from senior freelancers on newbies
- Rate management and coordination
- Treatment sanitization coordination for portfolio building
- First point of contact for freelancer inquiries

**Key Quote:**
> "I'm here so that I can kind of like, answer to freelancers needs... that's what I feel is kind of like the point of me existing as a position."

---

## Weekly Workflow

### Monday Routine (HR Review Prep)

**Primary Task: Feedback Collection**
- Updates "Newbie Tracker" sheet with weekly projects
- Reaches out to senior freelancers via WhatsApp for feedback on newbies
- Collects feedback on every newbie-senior pairing from the previous week
- Sometimes requires follow-up calls when people feel "cornered" giving feedback

**Time Investment:**
- Feedback collection: Throughout Monday + sporadic calls
- Sheet updates: Continuous throughout day (ADHD makes batching difficult)

**Why WhatsApp vs Discord:**
> "I pile up a whole week's worth of projects on a Monday, and that makes it so that a lot of the people that work during the week are not necessarily working that Monday... they would not have to check their Discord."

**Coordination:**
- Reviews calendar with booking team (Madalena, Elise)
- Makes recommendations for project assignments based on feedback
- Acts as "holding the line" to ensure equitable distribution (e.g., Maria got 3 assists, Louise got 0)

---

## Major Pain Points & Time Drains

### 1. Onboarding Master Sheet (Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH)

**Description:**
- Tracks all freelancer applicants from first contact through onboarding
- Two main tabs: Applications pipeline + Current onboarding progress
- Tracks: Name, contact, first contact date, role, interview status, assessment progress, test results, notes

**Leonor's Sentiment:**
> "I hate it to the point that I tend to avoid it and then have to spend the whole day updating it."

> "I made it so that it would be an excruciating detail and filling it out is a bore... it's a lot of buttons for, like, very little payout."

**Frequency:**
- Weekly updates: New applicants (5/month average) - simple data entry
- Deep dives: Every 1-2 months when onboarding cycle begins
- Deep dive includes: CV review, portfolio analysis, benefit assessment

**Time Investment:**
- Weekly updates: 5-10 minutes per applicant
- Deep dive preparation: **2-4 hours to half a day** (procrastination compounds this)
- Post-interview data entry: 5-10 minutes per interview (from Pierre's emails)

**Data Flow:**
1. Applicants reach out via email (hello@ambushed, Pierre's, Leonor's)
2. Leonor logs initial contact in sheet
3. Pierre conducts interviews → sends email summary to Leonor
4. Leonor updates sheet with interview notes and next steps
5. Sheet becomes reference for next onboarding wave

**Pain Point Analysis:**
- Task avoidance due to tedium
- Necessary detail level (applications can sit 1-2 months before action)
- No immediate reward/feedback loop
- Anxiety about missing details leads to over-checking emails

---

### 2. Dual Rate Management System (Priority: HIGH - TOP PAIN POINT)

**The Problem:**
Freelancer rates must be manually updated in TWO separate sheets:
1. **Team Directory** - Main reference
2. **FCA (Freelancer Cost something)** - Invoicing/booking reference

**Frequency:**
- Rate changes: Bi-weekly discussions in HR calls
- Batch processing: Often raises multiple people in one day
- Monthly alignment check: First Monday of every month

**Time Investment:**
- Per rate change: 5 minutes per person per sheet = 10 minutes total
- Call with freelancer: 30 minutes (discusses raise + check-in on support needs)
- Follow-up email: Formalizing the rate change
- **Monthly alignment audit: 30 minutes** (first Monday)
- **Weekly spot checks: ~10 minutes** (checking specific raises)
- **Total monthly: ~70 minutes on sheet alignment alone**

**Error Pattern:**
- Errors occur ~once every 3 months
- Usually caught by booking team (Madalena/Elise) during invoicing
- Freelancer's timesheet shows Rate A, FCA shows Rate B
- Triggers back-and-forth: Booking team messages Leonor → Leonor checks both sheets → Updates missing one
- Resolution time: ~10 minutes per error

**Downstream Impact:**
- Affects Madalena and Elise (booking/invoicing team)
- Affects Sinbad (when he's in AMBUSHED oversight rotation, not always on HR calls)
- Creates context-switching interruptions for Leonor

**Leonor's Top Priority Fix:**
> "I guess I'm going to go with having the team directory and the FCA somehow aligned. If they were both one thing, that would make a good difference for me."

**Frustration Rating: 4-5/10**

**Why Not Higher:**
> "These are all things that I find to be kind of like around my job but not the point of my job."

### 3. Treatment Sanitization Coordination (Priority: CRITICAL - CURRENT BACKLOG)

**Purpose:**
- Anonymize client treatments for freelancer portfolios
- Producers request portfolios when considering freelancers for projects
- Without portfolios, booking team must "verbally argue" for freelancers

**Process:**
1. Leonor identifies need (e.g., 8 people need portfolios now)
2. Adds projects to Portfolio Sheet for art director review
3. Art directors (Pierre/Sinbad) comment on which versions to sanitize
4. Leonor gathers treatments that need sanitizing
5. Locates assets per treatment (varies by platform: InDesign, ReadyMag, Figma)
6. Assigns 6 treatments per freelancer (2-3 freelancers per batch)
7. Freelancer duplicates, sanitizes, republishes (3 hours per treatment)
8. Leonor receives new link, adds to Project Directory + Portfolio Sheet
9. Reviews sanitized version (10 minutes per treatment)

**Current Backlog:**
- 8 freelancers need portfolios
- 6 treatments per portfolio = 48 treatments needed
- 10 already completed = **38 treatments remaining**

**Leonor's Time Investment Per Treatment:**
- Asset gathering (varies by platform): 1-2 hours per batch of 6
- Locating InDesign packages, requesting ReadyMag/Figma duplicates from art directors
- Review per treatment: 10 minutes
- **Total per treatment: ~1-1.5 hours of Leonor's time**

**Freelancer Cost Per Treatment:**
- 3 hours at average rate of €18/hour = **€54 per treatment**
- 38 treatments remaining = **€2,052 in outstanding sanitization costs**
- Used to pay flat €25/treatment (freelancers complained it wasn't enough)

**Ideal Frequency:** Once per quarter (10-12 treatments)
**Current Reality:** Massive backlog from lack of system

**Why This Is The Biggest Pain:**
> "This is the biggest pain for me because it doesn't tie into any of my other work."

**Impact on Booking Team:**
- Without portfolios, Madalena/Elise can't send "Harry [hyperlink]"
- Must verbally pitch freelancers to producers
- Reduces credibility and booking efficiency

**Pressure Level:**
> "There is some pressure, I would say. Especially from Madalena."

**Historical Context:**
- Madalena used to handle this
- When Leonor took HR role, Madalena asked her to coordinate
- Confusion about how to execute led to 2024 backlog pileup

**Post-Treatment Form Reference:**
- Freelancers submit form after each project
- Includes: total hours, standby hours, final product link
- Leonor uses this to find InDesign packages for sanitization

---

## Communication Channels

**Primary Tools:**
- WhatsApp (feedback collection - reaches people when not working)
- Discord (general team communication - requires active work status)
- Email (formal communications, rate confirmations, applicant correspondence)
- Google Sheets (Newbie Tracker, Onboarding Master, Team Directory, FCA, Portfolio Sheet, Post-Treatment Form)
- Kit (newsletter platform - side project, deprioritized)

**Channel Selection Logic:**
- WhatsApp for Monday feedback collection → People aren't working, won't check Discord
- Calls for rate discussions → Personal touch, also collect freelancer feedback on support

---

## Onboarding Process

**Leonor's Role:** Logistical support (not interviewer)

**Flow:**
1. Applicants reach out via email (website form, personal recommendations)
2. Leonor is first point of contact
3. Leonor schedules with Pierre (sends calendar link)
4. Pierre conducts interview
5. Pierre sends email summary to Leonor
6. Leonor updates Onboarding Master Sheet
7. Leonor sends assessment test (if approved)
8. Tracks assessment progress
9. Coordinates onboarding when cleared

**Application Volume:** ~5 new applicants per month

**Source Mix:**
- Website contact form
- Personal recommendations (common)
- hello@ambushed.tv
- Direct to Leonor or Pierre's email

---

## Rate Management Details

**HR Call Participants:**
- Pierre (co-founder)
- Art Director on duty
- Assistant Art Director on duty
- Booking team (Madalena, Elise)
- Leonor

**Frequency:** Bi-weekly (averages out with different focuses)

**Rate Range:**
- Minimum for new freelancers: €15/hour
- Average/middle: €17-18/hour
- Example (Desiree): €20/hour

**Process:**
1. Freelancer requests raise with justification (progress, goals, timeline)
2. HR call discusses merit
3. Leonor schedules 30-min call with freelancer
4. Call covers: Good news about raise + check-in on support needs, highlights/lowlights
5. Leonor sends formal email confirming new rate
6. **Leonor updates Team Directory**
7. **Leonor updates FCA** ← Often gets interrupted/forgotten
8. Team Directory shows: "Raised to €20/hour on 27th Jan"

**Context Switching Issue:**
> "By the time that I'm like, OK, let me update the FCA, maybe I have to get on another call. And then, you know what I mean?"

---

## Core Job vs. System Maintenance

**Leonor's Actual Job (in her view):**
> "I'm also here so that I can kind of like, answer to freelancers needs."

**Types of Support Requests:**
- "I'm not sure how to invoice for this"
- "I think I made a mistake in my invoice, how do I correct it?"
- "If I were to take three months off, would you guys fire me?"
- "I'm really looking to move up, what can I do?"

**Time Allocation Reality:**
> "These are all things that I find to be kind of like around my job but not the point of my job."

**The Trade-off:**
> "If the systems were a bit more straightforward or interconnected somehow, then that would shave off some time that would make it so that the response to freelancers themselves could be a little bit more... quality... A little bit more focused."

**Freelancer Feedback on New Role:**
- Leonor's position is "a toddler" (new, still developing)
- Before: Freelancers reached out to Madalena, Leonor, or Elise (booking team split duties)
- Result was: Freelancers felt "a lot less supportive and a lot less heard"
- Current feedback: "It's cool that we have this one person that we can reach out to"
- No complaints about insufficient support since Leonor took over

## Automation & System Improvement Opportunities

### HIGH PRIORITY: Dual Rate System

**Problem:** Manual sync between Team Directory and FCA
**Impact:** 70 min/month + error resolution + downstream interruptions
**Solution Opportunity:**
- Single source of truth with automatic sync
- Or: Formula-based reference in FCA pulling from Team Directory
- Notification system when rates change (alerts booking team)

**ROI Potential:**
- Saves Leonor: 70 min/month = 14 hours/year
- Eliminates booking team interruptions: ~4 interruptions/year × 15 min = 1 hour/year
- Reduces error-induced stress/context switching

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Onboarding Master Sheet

**Problem:** Tedious manual data entry, avoidance behavior, anxiety about completeness
**Impact:** 2-4 hours every 1-2 months in procrastination-amplified work sessions
**Solution Opportunity:**
- Form-based intake that auto-populates sheet
- Integration with email (parse Pierre's interview summaries)
- Dashboard view to reduce "excruciating detail" overload
- Automated reminders for follow-ups

**ROI Potential:**
- Reduces deep-dive sessions from 4 hours to 1-2 hours
- Eliminates anxiety-driven email re-checking
- Could save 12-24 hours/year

---

### CRITICAL PRIORITY: Treatment Sanitization Workflow

**Problem:** Multi-step manual coordination, asset hunting, platform variability
**Current Backlog Cost:** 38 treatments × €54 = €2,052
**Leonor's Time:** 38 treatments × 1 hour = 38 hours backlog

**Solution Opportunity:**
1. **Asset Management System**
   - Standardized asset storage location per project
   - Post-Treatment Form auto-links to asset package
   - Eliminate "hunting" across InDesign/ReadyMag/Figma

2. **Sanitization Request Workflow**
   - Art directors flag projects for sanitization at completion (not retrospectively)
   - Auto-populates sanitization queue
   - Assigns to freelancers with notifications

3. **Portfolio Auto-Generation**
   - Sanitized projects auto-add to portfolio system
   - Booking team has live access to updated portfolios

**ROI Potential:**
- Reduces Leonor's time per treatment from 1 hour to 15 minutes (75% reduction)
- Eliminates backlog buildup pattern
- Ongoing savings: 10-12 treatments/quarter × 45 min saved = 7.5-9 hours/quarter = 30-36 hours/year

---

### LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY: Feedback Collection System

**Current State:** Manual WhatsApp outreach every Monday, manual sheet updates
**Solution Opportunity:**
- Form-based feedback submission from seniors
- Monday reminder automation
- Auto-population of Newbie Tracker
- Analytics/dashboard for trends

**ROI Potential:**
- Moderate time savings (2-3 hours/week → 1 hour/week)
- Improved data consistency
- Better trend visibility for HR decisions

## Cross-Role Observations (vs. James Interview)

**Shared Pain Points:**
1. **Asset Management Chaos**
   - James: Struggles to find assets across email threads for creative work
   - Leonor: Struggles to find assets (InDesign packages, ReadyMag, Figma) for sanitization
   - **Common Root Cause:** No centralized asset management system

2. **Multi-Sheet Syndrome**
   - James: Likely uses Project Directory, potentially other sheets
   - Leonor: Team Directory, FCA, Onboarding Master, Portfolio Sheet, Post-Treatment Form, Newbie Tracker
   - **Common Root Cause:** Disconnected systems requiring manual sync

3. **Role Friction: Admin vs. Core Work**
   - James: Creative work interrupted by system maintenance
   - Leonor: Community support interrupted by system maintenance
   - **Common Pattern:** Both spend 40-45% of time on "around my job" tasks

**Leonor-Specific Challenges:**
- HR/people management requires relationship time (30-min calls, support conversations)
- System failures create relationship strain (rate errors, delayed portfolios affect trust)
- ADHD + multiple interrupting streams (feedback, support requests) = context switching pain
