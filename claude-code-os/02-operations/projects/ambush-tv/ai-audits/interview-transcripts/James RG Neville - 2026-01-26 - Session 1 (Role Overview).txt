James RG Neville: I live in Almeria.
James RG Neville: Oh, man.
Sway Clarke: That's why it looks so warm and cozy where you're at.
Sway Clarke: Nice, man.
Sway Clarke: Nice.
Sway Clarke: How long have been there?
James RG Neville: Kind of since 2020 on and off.
James RG Neville: Okay.
James RG Neville: For a long time, me and my wife did sort of half the year in London, half the year here.
James RG Neville: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: And then we had a kid, and then you kind of got to pick.
Sway Clarke: Well, you don't have to, but any responsible human being would, right?
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
James RG Neville: It was like just getting on endless flights with like a baby.
James RG Neville: You're always going to roll the dice, and that's kind of stressful.
James RG Neville: And then now he goes to like nursery, and it just feels real stupid to like spend all this money on nursery and then just like take them, not take them to it and stuff.
Sway Clarke: I don't know.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: i got two little ones so i know exactly what you're talking about hey how old are they um zero is five she just turned five zero zero okay yeah zero is not zero anymore she's five and montego is uh two and a half he's gonna be three in april hell yeah yeah so it's how old is your little one he's two and a half too oh that age bro yeah i'm how old are you what real question real question i think a lot of people you know are discussing discussing child number two and people are like oh they play together it makes it so much easier but i think they're smoking copium i don't think that's real no no no no no i'll tell you real talk real talk two kids are much better than one yeah yeah man yeah man yeah man i like whenever my kids are by themselves like my wife takes one kid and we gotta go
Sway Clarke: Like, daughter goes to a birthday party, and I'm with my son, it's really clear to me that you've got nobody else to  play with but me, and I've got to be your homie for the whole day.
Sway Clarke: Like, I'm with you the whole time.
Sway Clarke: Like, and what do you want to do?
Sway Clarke: And I want to do that.
Sway Clarke: I don't have that with my two kids.
Sway Clarke: I'm like, look, guys, I've to go work.
Sway Clarke: You guys go play.
Sway Clarke: Find something to do.
Sway Clarke: Go to your trains, and they just do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
Sway Clarke: You know, they go to a park.
Sway Clarke: They'll just leave, and they'll play, and they'll do their thing.
Sway Clarke: It's, I really, I couldn't do with one kid, man.
Sway Clarke: Damn.
Sway Clarke: It's just too much.
Sway Clarke: It's too much, like, yeah, like, what are we doing this weekend, Dad?
Sway Clarke: I'm like, we're not doing anything with my kids.
Sway Clarke: I'm staying home, and you guys are going to play in your room or go in the backyard.
Sway Clarke: Yes.
Sway Clarke: They're cool.
Sway Clarke: Honestly, like, I can't imagine just having one kid.
Sway Clarke: It is a bit, it's a bit of a hump.
Sway Clarke: Like, you're going to get over the hump of, like, the managing of two kids.
Sway Clarke: And it's.
Sway Clarke: depends on what age you do it at.
Sway Clarke: I would do it quicker than later because all my friends that had kids like four years old and then they had their next one, I think the gap's too big.
Sway Clarke: Like a four-year-old doesn't play with a six-month-old, and then by the time they're eight and it's four, it's like too different.
Sway Clarke: One's going into school, the other one's learning how to walk or some , right?
Sway Clarke: Got you, got you.
Sway Clarke: So that's my feedback on it.
Sway Clarke: I'm like, go for it, man, really.
Sway Clarke: It's, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
Sway Clarke: We're thinking about a third anyway, so we're crazy like that.
Sway Clarke: All right, stop.
Sway Clarke: But hey, you know what?
Sway Clarke: Okay, so I think we should jump in because I don't want to take up your whole day.
Sway Clarke: I'm sure you've got a lot of things to do.
Sway Clarke: But I don't know if you've talked with Sinbad or Pierre at all prior to the call or anybody else.
Sway Clarke: But yeah, basically what I do is I have a company called Alaksa and I work with businesses like yourself.
Sway Clarke: don't.
Sway Clarke: I
Sway Clarke: And trying to figure out like, OK, what are the inefficiencies?
Sway Clarke: What are the processes?
Sway Clarke: What are the workflows?
Sway Clarke: How are things working?
Sway Clarke: And essentially helping to improve them, right?
Sway Clarke: So sometimes it's, you know, implementation of some type of technology.
Sway Clarke: Sometimes it's just we need a protocol here, right?
Sway Clarke: It really kind of depends.
Sway Clarke: And so I'm just doing what I would call like an audit on everybody that's involved in the business to kind of understand what your roles are, where, and most importantly, like, where you hand off information, right?
Sway Clarke: Like, where do you get information?
Sway Clarke: Where do you hand it off?
Sway Clarke: And how do those things kind of happen?
Sway Clarke: And so I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions.
Sway Clarke: I have like, I'm usually writing or taking notes on my digital pad here, or I have some questions that I want to make sure that I ask.
Sway Clarke: But I think to start out, I'd love to just find out like, what, what does your week look like?
Sway Clarke: What does your role look like?
Sway Clarke: What does your week look like?
Sway Clarke: What does the day look like for you?
Sway Clarke: Cool.
James RG Neville: All right.
James RG Neville: Well, so first of the two of me,
James RG Neville: Zoe and I share the same role, and in order for AMBUSH to be running every day of the week, every day of the month, every day of the year, except for Christmas, we do this like shift schedule, so I work for four days, and then Zoe works for four days, and I have four days off, and then whilst I'm working my four days, Zoe's taking four days off, so we do, so our work week is four days on, four days off, so we've got kind of a weird eight-day work week, but when we are working, you know, like, generally I work from nine, maybe 9.30 to about two in the morning, so it's like, four days off, nine to two?
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: Wow, okay.
Sway Clarke: Yes.
James RG Neville: And that's my, that's the one thing I really want to change, is I don't want to go about it.
Sway Clarke: Exactly.
Sway Clarke: Well, I don't know if I can change that yet.
Sway Clarke: I don't know if that's.
Sway Clarke: It's power, but I'd love to know what does a 9 to 2 look like?
Sway Clarke: What are you doing when you get there?
James RG Neville: So I kind of feel like I'm involved in basically everything.
James RG Neville: Outside of billing and payroll stuff, I don't deal with anything like that, but everything else I've got like a hand in.
James RG Neville: So my main role is being the art director, so I'm kind of on boots on the ground with all the projects.
James RG Neville: I try and emphasize more at the beginning of projects to make sure that the first day, maybe the first two days are set up well enough that I can sort of let them kind of manage themselves.
James RG Neville: So I'll work with the designer to come up with a plan of action to sort of articulate the projects in a graphic design kind of sense.
James RG Neville: I'll use my expertise from doing this job for a long time to help the visual research.
James RG Neville: itiquer锟斤拷韯板僵讬
James RG Neville: sure to point them in the right direction as well as research.
James RG Neville: I'll be on hand to facilitate everything, make sure everybody's got the right materials.
James RG Neville: I will problem solve, I will liaise with the clients, be they the directors or the producers, or both, for various things.
James RG Neville: I'll rearrange company assets depending on how projects are going.
James RG Neville: Like if there's one that for some reason the visual research isn't hitting, I'll move personnel around on the fly.
James RG Neville: And then on top of that, I do a lot of AI image making every day.
James RG Neville: I usually use that as a kind of sort of filler, so I'm always trying to be productive.
James RG Neville: And there's always kind of like images that could be tweaked in a little way or like custom images that could be made.
James RG Neville: So I'll do that a lot during the day, but like in amongst all these other kind of more.
James RG Neville: Major roles that I do.
James RG Neville: And then in terms of booking, I keep an eye on bookings and stuff, making sure that the right team is out to the right project.
James RG Neville: I'll often have some insider information about the directors or the production, what they like, they don't like.
James RG Neville: And then on the weekends...
Sway Clarke: is this prior to the actual job starting?
Sway Clarke: Like if you say you're going to have a gig that's going to run from Monday to Thursday, you're saying when you're finding insights about the directors and all that kind of stuff, mapping this out, this is pre-actual start.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, exactly.
James RG Neville: the producer would be like, hey, we've got a pitch with director Joe Bloggs, and I'll be like, oh, we worked with them before, they like this kind of style, like maybe this freelancer would be a good pick if we can get them.
James RG Neville: They like their treatments to look very simplistic, so we don't need like a designer that kind of goes hard with the design, and they just won't be a right fit.
James RG Neville: So I try and weigh in with those conversations because ultimately they affect me the most.
Sway Clarke: I'm sorry, I'm going to ask a bunch of questions, but these are conversations that you're having through email or like on the phone, like is it a conference call or like?
Sway Clarke: Discord.
Sway Clarke: Discord.
Sway Clarke: It's a call.
Sway Clarke: No, it's like Slack.
Sway Clarke: Discord.
Sway Clarke: Oh, you said Discord.
Sway Clarke: Okay, Discord.
Sway Clarke: So the producer is going to be on Discord, you're going to be on No, no, no.
James RG Neville: This is a conversation I'm having with the booking team, so Madalena, Leonor.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so you have an upcoming project, you're doing your prep for the upcoming project with Madalena and Alice or Leonor, for example, on Discord.
James RG Neville: Correct.
James RG Neville: So during Monday to Friday, one of them is in charge of the bookings.
James RG Neville: And just because I'm a bit, I don't know, I feel like, again, because it affects me the most, I kind of keep an eye on it and I weigh in with any critique.
James RG Neville: go.
James RG Neville: go.
James RG Neville: So adjustments or suggestions that I might have on the weekends when my shift is on the weekends, I just do all the bookings.
Sway Clarke: You do the bookings yourself on the weekends if you're working on the weekends because none of those, the three aren't working on the weekends.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so you do do some of the bookings then, okay.
Sway Clarke: So you have pre-prep, which is figuring out all the idiosyncrasies of the directors, the production house that you're working with.
Sway Clarke: You're sorting that out in order to put together the right team of freelancers that are going to be best for your job to make your job easier when you're actually there.
Sway Clarke: Bingo, exactly.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
James RG Neville: Extra, extra things to think about in that situation is having a look through the agency deck if it's available and sort of asserting or asserting if it's going to be a sort of an AI heavy job.
James RG Neville: If there's like a sort of big AI component to the image making, that will dictate our decision about which visual researches to pull from.
James RG Neville: You mean because some are better than others?
James RG Neville: Exactly.
James RG Neville: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Sway Clarke: And interesting.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so that's, so I'm trying to understand.
Sway Clarke: So you got your pre-prep, and how long does the pre-prep usually take before any given job?
James RG Neville: It depends.
James RG Neville: Sometimes the producers put a feeler out a week in advance is nice, but they don't often know if the job is confirmed for them until later down the line.
James RG Neville: So normally we have to kind of plan these jobs one or two days before they start.
James RG Neville: Okay.
James RG Neville: People, if it lands over the weekend, sometimes people like to get things organized before the weekend starts.
James RG Neville: Yeah.
James RG Neville: So you've been given a little bit more of a buffer there, but not...
James RG Neville: But in general, yeah, you're one or two days, sometimes you're given a vague heads up beforehand, and on very nice occasions, they book it like in a week in advance, or a couple of weeks in advance, but very uncommon.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so it's really short notice.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, mean, film industry, right?
Sway Clarke: So short, short notice before and then when you're getting on the ground, as I understand you, you know, book in at nine o'clock, and your first thing, is what getting all your freelancers organized.
Sway Clarke: So you have must have some kind of like, you doing meetings, actually, that's one question I have.
Sway Clarke: And are when you were mentioning about moving people around all of these people that are moving around, they're your, they're essentially your employees, right?
Sway Clarke: These are ambush employees, they're not from the production company, they're not from the directors, they're your, your set.
Sway Clarke: Exactly.
Sway Clarke: I mean, they're, they're freelancers.
James RG Neville: But yeah, they are, they're our assets.
James RG Neville: Okay, okay.
Sway Clarke: And if you were to
Sway Clarke: Give me like an average day in, like from nine to two, what does it look like?
James RG Neville: So today, today's like not the most mental day, but we do have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
James RG Neville: We do have eight different projects on in various stages.
Sway Clarke: Eight different projects in different cities at different stages.
Sway Clarke: Okay, and you're managing all of these?
James RG Neville: Yeah, some of them I will, I've given to the, my assistant to sort of handle for today.
James RG Neville: If they need my expertise for some reason, they'll tag me and I'll weigh in.
James RG Neville: But a couple of them I would sort of like.
Sway Clarke: What are you looking at that you're managing it?
James RG Neville: I'm looking at Google.
James RG Neville: Do you want me to share my screen?
James RG Neville: Yeah, sure.
Sway Clarke: All right.
Sway Clarke: All right.
James RG Neville: All right, this is the schedule.
James RG Neville: Okay, okay, so this is the schedule for Monday today.
Sway Clarke: So you've got Palms, Chase Bank, Palms Casino.
Sway Clarke: Okay, these are all jobs that are somewhat running today.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: Somewhere in the middle, they're cascading, it looks like.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, exactly.
Sway Clarke: Okay, and so you're running everything from here?
Sway Clarke: Like from your, I don't know, your office, your kitchen, or wherever?
Sway Clarke: Are you on site or are you here?
James RG Neville: Nah, always work from home.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so you're working from home.
Sway Clarke: So you're constantly flipping between calendar, the calendar here on the Google Sheets, your emails that you're getting, updates on Discord.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Please.
Sway Clarke: Thank
James RG Neville: So I do all my conversations with all the AMBUSHED personnel in Discord, mostly through text chats, and it's all organized by job into different channels.
James RG Neville: Sometimes in face-to-face meetings in the rooms, often that's kind of good if you need to problem solve or just people are confused or people have hit a dead end, you need to talk things through.
James RG Neville: But generally, it's just text chats.
James RG Neville: And then again, yeah, loads of emails to client side.
Sway Clarke: Okay, and then emails to the producers, emails back and forth, they want updates, they want information.
Sway Clarke: And then the director naturally has an assistant or somebody that you're talking to?
Sway Clarke: Not often.
James RG Neville: Generally, we work directly with the...
James RG Neville: director, or if they're not available, ideally a producer steps in, um, occasionally it's through WhatsApp, um, I prefer to not set up WhatsApp groups.
James RG Neville: So I, I, find them really annoying, but some of us, um, suggest like insist on WhatsApp groups, which is fine.
Sway Clarke: Um, in a general sense, this form of communication works like this text based, like talking to the, to the freelancers while they're on site.
Sway Clarke: You know, they're in London or something, doing a, doing a shoot, text based information, moving to video in discord, if that works generally, or, yeah, I, it certainly works for me.
James RG Neville: Um, I haven't really heard anyone complain about it.
James RG Neville: Okay.
James RG Neville: I think also with our company where everyone's in, it's so seasoned to like the way treatments are made that it just feels like second nature now.
Sway Clarke: Um,
Sway Clarke: And so I'm still I'm still trying to get a grasp of like, you know, you grab your coffee, you drop your son off, probably at the quita or the kindergarten, you come back, you make a coffee, you sit down at a computer, and then what does it look like?
Sway Clarke: Like, what are you opening?
Sway Clarke: Like, what, what, what's the, what happens?
Sway Clarke: Fair enough.
James RG Neville: So my busiest times are generally in the morning, and then in the evening.
James RG Neville: morning, because I am, I start by opening this calendar, and then I'll go from top to bottom, project to project, and then I will say hi to the team members, I will check my emails to see if there's been any emails overnight for said projects, because a lot of our clients are US-based, so we always have like a tonne of emails overnight.
James RG Neville: I will digest the emails, or I will digest brief, and give a little top.
James RG Neville: but
James RG Neville: I direction for each of the team members, even if it's like good morning, feedback's been great, like just carry on, you know, like I want to make sure that everyone knows I'm present.
Sway Clarke: Hold on, I've got to the door.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Be back.
James RG Neville: Bye.
James RG Neville: Often there's a fair bit of like translating, like a director speak to some sort of graphic design lingo, you know, they'll like say, oh, it just doesn't feel premium enough.
James RG Neville: And I need to translate that into actual actionable things for the designer to sort of do.
Sway Clarke: Sorry.
Sway Clarke: So this is direct information from the director.
Sway Clarke: Director messages you, hey James, man, I got this, this image I don't really like.
Sway Clarke: Can you get it pumped up or something?
Sway Clarke: And then you translate that to one of the freelancers on-site?
James RG Neville: I will translate that to them via Discord.
James RG Neville: They'll be wherever they live.
James RG Neville: And I'll figure out what the director...
James RG Neville: Because often the directors don't speak like graphic designers.
James RG Neville: They don't necessarily speak like visual researchers as well.
James RG Neville: Often there's a slight language barrier as well, in many cases.
James RG Neville: So you kind of figure out what's going on.
James RG Neville: Okay, okay.
Sway Clarke: So you were saying that you give everybody some feedback and direction?
Sway Clarke: Yeah, exactly.
James RG Neville: So I'll go through the list and approach each project piecemeal and try and make sure that I know at least that every team member knows what they're meant to be doing.
James RG Neville: A lot of the time people are so seasoned that it's kind of autopilot for them.
James RG Neville: It's like kind of obvious.
James RG Neville: But then...
James RG Neville: Might be some expertise that I can weigh in on, like, oh, hey, like, we need some more imagery of dogs, so you can look here in this past project, or we need to find a new title typeface, and I'll, like, come up with some options for them.
James RG Neville: And then, you know, that's sort of all happening at the same time as, like, loads of other people are asking me questions.
James RG Neville: But once I'm, like, over that kind of slog in the morning...
James RG Neville: How long does that take you to do all that?
James RG Neville: Normally get it done, so I normally start around between 9 and 9.30.
James RG Neville: I'm normally done around 11.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so hour, hour and a half to two hours of just general updates, like, going through the information, going through the update, the emails, finding out what's the recaps.
Sway Clarke: using ending with minutes to better.
Sway Clarke: And don't So.
Sway Clarke: And then sending out your responses based on what, the directions based on the feedback you've gotten.
Sway Clarke: Exactly.
James RG Neville: Occasionally there's new members of the team, so sometimes like, let me find an example, like today, Baldishar was doing, well yesterday Baldishar was doing visual research on this project, but it switched over to Slea today, so making sure that Slea has everything she needs.
James RG Neville: An update, a handover on Slea.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, exactly.
James RG Neville: Like, I'll probably ask her like in a bit if she understands, if she feels like she understands the project.
James RG Neville: Are there problems with this?
Sway Clarke: Do you have issues with this?
Sway Clarke: Like handovers or like updates and feedback?
James RG Neville: No, I think it's quite, I think it's quite good that I do this quite granularly because it helps me understand them as well.
James RG Neville: Yeah.
James RG Neville: And I like to some degree knowing what's going on about all the projects, it helps me understand.
James RG Neville: Absolutely.
James RG Neville: time.
James RG Neville: like have a grasp at what's going on on a whole or at least if I don't know I've delegated to somebody who does know you know so I mentioned before I have an assistant that's another assistant yeah exactly so there's Zoe and I are the senior art directors and then there's Alexi and Gaetano who are the junior art directors or our assistants and they're another sort of resource that I like to direct around and get them to focus on things that either I don't want to focus on or that need extra help what what are those things for example things that you don't want to focus on or things that you need extra help on so for for instance today there's this job arena which is on its final day so I prefer to not focus on things on the final day
James RG Neville: Because they should be in a sort of kind of good state and it'd down to sort of nitty gritty details and I find those take up loads of time where I should be focusing on kind of more macro things on projects starting out.
James RG Neville: So I've asked Alexi to look after this project because there was some kind of, it wasn't negative feedback, but it was like a lot needs to change.
James RG Neville: So I'm going to make sure that that job is covered because I was worried about it.
James RG Neville: But because I don't know very much about that job and Alexi has more experience in it because, I'll explain why, I'm like, hey, Alexi, can you focus on that?
James RG Neville: So I don't need to, it's out of my mind and I could focus on more important things for me.
James RG Neville: And the reason why he knows more than me is because they have a similar four day on, four day off structure, but it's staggered by mind by two days, if that makes sense.
James RG Neville: you.
James RG Neville: Thank you
Sway Clarke: There's always a slight overlap that somebody knows something from the day before, okay?
Sway Clarke: Exactamunda.
James RG Neville: Okay, okay, okay.
Sway Clarke: And so, and just if you could briefly tell me, what are the, what are these jobs in there that you're like, I don't want to deal with that?
Sway Clarke: Like, what is that thing?
Sway Clarke: Like, you're like, I don't know, last days, I don't know, just spend my time doing better things.
Sway Clarke: What are those things?
James RG Neville: So often you get to the point where you are getting really granular feedback, which is like, page 48, change this image for the image on page 32.
James RG Neville: And stuff like that is, takes a lot of brain, you know, that's a really obvious example, a really easy example, but those kind of take up a lot of brain space.
James RG Neville: It's, where, uh, it's less sort of, um, it's, it's in the weeds, you know?
James RG Neville: Yeah.
James RG Neville: Like confusing things where like the text is not being.
Sway Clarke: updated and like maybe the text is put in the wrong spot or like um the when they were saying change the image on 42 it was like on a different version and now there's extra pages so you have to kind of plus two pages and blah blah blah you'd like to take care of the macro problems the macro issues and these kind of like things that you would say they're not really going to move the needle if if the ad is not done by now then it's not done right now guys like come on the text here is not going to change it you would put that off to an assistant and say please just close this up and handle those things because i don't i got to move on to like setting up another project exactly 100 okay you said a couple things you your your your main bulk of work is in the morning um then you get that you know afternoon to like watch youtube and then in the nighttime you're back at work kind of do your back work of and so you you you you.
Sway Clarke: Oh, no, no, no.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Maybe I didn't, maybe I didn't lay it out right.
Sway Clarke: I was, I was going to get you to continue because you just showed me what happened in the morning, what happens in the evening, afternoon to the night now.
Sway Clarke: All right.
James RG Neville: Generally, yeah, in the afternoon, lunchtime, afternoons, it is a little bit calmer and I get to sit down and that's often when I do a lot of visual research myself or AI image generating myself.
James RG Neville: Okay.
James RG Neville: In the afternoon.
James RG Neville: There's still quite a lot of emails to answer to, people have questions, but there's not this kind of onslaught at the beginning and the bit in the evening, which is another onslaught that I'll get to.
James RG Neville: Often there's like meetings scheduled for this time as well.
James RG Neville: I have one meeting with you and then possibly one coming up afterwards.
James RG Neville: But generally the tempo is a bit lower unless there's some major issue and I get to sit down and do some long form work.
James RG Neville: video.
James RG Neville: everyone.
James RG Neville: Bye Bye
James RG Neville: Which is generally like visual research.
James RG Neville: The AI visual research.
Sway Clarke: So this is all of these projects that you're working on, they have requests for like visual mood boards or something like they need, and then you're going to get an email about this or something on Discord, and then you're going to put that together and then shoot that back off to the director or the producer.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: I guess, maybe, I don't know.
James RG Neville: The average project, you've got two components.
James RG Neville: You've got the visual research side.
James RG Neville: So the visual researcher will find imagery that matches the brief.
James RG Neville: And then the design side, which is taking those imagery and organizing it in a way that matches the text and also the graphic design whole thing elevates the pitch.
James RG Neville: There's a little bit of overlap between those two jobs because the visual researcher will pick the images.
James RG Neville: .
James RG Neville: .
James RG Neville: For the designer to use, and then in amongst that, will work both ends, I'll work with the designer to make the graphic design look as good as it can be, and I will work with the visual research to make the visuals look as good as they can be, and I will also help with the arranging and selection of the images to go into the design to best tell the story.
James RG Neville: So that's the majority of projects.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so it's, it sounds like actually also, I'm also interested that it sounds like once you get the bookings and everything done, and you have your team set, you're not really, are you still working with a lot of information between Maddalena or Alice or Leonor regularly?
Sway Clarke: Or are you in your kind of world now doing your design stuff with the producers and the directors and try to keep and keeping that together?
Sway Clarke: That's what it sounds like a bit.
James RG Neville: Yeah, yeah, Unless there's some sort of personnel issue.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
James RG Neville: Or extra resources like, hey Maddalena, this is.
James RG Neville: This trickier than I thought.
James RG Neville: We need a researcher.
James RG Neville: We won't be able to get this done in the time that we've been given.
James RG Neville: Can you go back to the producer and ask for more resources?
James RG Neville: Can we book an extra person on this?
James RG Neville: Or somebody might be like, hey, James, I'm actually not feeling very well today.
James RG Neville: It's OK if you find somebody to cover me and I'll be like, sure.
James RG Neville: And then I'll go ask Ben and Elena.
James RG Neville: Generally, as soon as the project starts, Madalena, Elise and Leonore aren't that involved at all.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, they're more organized.
Sway Clarke: OK.
Sway Clarke: And so I got I mean, I've got a ton of questions here.
Sway Clarke: So what is the.
Sway Clarke: Like of these things, because I'm assuming that the night I don't want to just assume, but I don't want to take too much time on that part.
Sway Clarke: But the night is is an extension of the morning in some ways.
Sway Clarke: Like it's not.
Sway Clarke: Are you doing a task that's completely different from the morning or is it more of kind of wrapping up emails?
Sway Clarke: Or.
Sway Clarke: Organizing, getting people ready for the next day, finding out what happened, getting feedback, is it safe to say that's kind of what the evenings are?
James RG Neville: Partially correct.
James RG Neville: The majority of the evenings is me reviewing the work that the freelancers have done.
James RG Neville: Okay.
James RG Neville: So, obviously, the earlier they get me a first draft or a work in progress, the better, and then I can start feeding back, but I also, you know, I don't want to hassle the freelancers to get stuff to me at times that they don't feel comfortable with, because I come from a graphic design background, and I know that if something's half complete, you don't want to show it because people are going to, anyway, I'm very respectful of that.
James RG Neville: So, normally around, like, six o'clock, I start getting, hey, James, check out this batch of images, or hey, James, check out this design, and then I'm going to
James RG Neville: I my seal of approval to those things, and my comments, and my critiques, sometimes get hands-on and tweak a few things, so that's when things get really ramped up, because not only am I getting a barrage of different, hey James, I want you to check this kind of messages, often that's when I realize there might be an issue or something that I need to help with myself.
James RG Neville: So a lot of my afternoon is trying to think about what issues might be in the evening, and try to bridge that gap, so I'm like, I know there's a really tricky bit of visual research on this project, there's a dog with an elephant on its back, that's going to be really hard to find.
James RG Neville: So I will, I know that that's going to be a sticking point in the future, that's what I'm working on in the afternoon, to try and stop me from
James RG Neville: I'm having a terrible time in the evening, and then on top of that, it is a lot of getting tomorrow's workload already done as well.
James RG Neville: So if there's a project starting tomorrow, I will make a design mood board, which is another quite major part of my job.
James RG Neville: Maybe it's easy if I show you what that entails.
James RG Neville: I haven't done any good ones this year, so I'm guessing.
Sway Clarke: You've got a lot of stuff going on that you're doing, James.
James RG Neville: Thanks for validating me.
James RG Neville: It's pretty crazy how you keep this all in your head.
James RG Neville: Yeah, I'm good at remembering loads of work stuff, which is weird because I'm like the exact opposite at home.
James RG Neville: Well, of course, you don't have any more space.
Sway Clarke: You're done.
Sway Clarke: Thank you for saying that.
James RG Neville: Yeah.
James RG Neville: What was a real...
James RG Neville: I could try and pick one that I think is cool.
James RG Neville: That's irrelevant.
James RG Neville: Okay, whatever this one.
James RG Neville: Cool.
James RG Neville: I will...
James RG Neville: I want to come up with a plan of action.
James RG Neville: Actually, this is...
James RG Neville: Okay, excuse me.
James RG Neville: Give me a moment.
James RG Neville: I'm going to find a good one.
James RG Neville: That was a bit...
James RG Neville: I cheated on that one.
Sway Clarke: So just while you're scrolling, just so I can get this straight.
Sway Clarke: So you get briefs, and then you're using AI to get mood board, like to get ideas.
Sway Clarke: And like, you're using that to generate it, then you're sending those off to somebody like a graphic designer or somebody to create these images.
Sway Clarke: And...
Sway Clarke: Then they're sending the images back to you to say, is this any good?
Sway Clarke: And then you're validating them and sending them forward?
James RG Neville: No, the AI imagery is to do with the visual researcher.
James RG Neville: So if the script of the film is the dog with the elephant on it, and it's driving a BMW, I will make imagery to illustrate that film, sometimes a video as well.
James RG Neville: So the AI is almost exclusively for the visual researchers.
James RG Neville: For the designer, the major input that I do is this mood board, which I'm just trying to find a good one to illustrate what I'm talking about.
James RG Neville: Yeah, all right, cool.
James RG Neville: So this is the thing that I will work on.
James RG Neville: Yeah.
James RG Neville: So I'm going to pull references of previous treatments.
James RG Neville: I'm going to write notes about what I like about them.
James RG Neville: I'm going to sometimes get into the weeds and come up with typeface combinations and stuff.
James RG Neville: I might start actually generating assets.
James RG Neville: Like these, These are generated assets that we used for the title pages.
Sway Clarke: And you do eight projects at a time, for example, like leading up to every project, you've got a new project tomorrow, you've got to do a new mood board, got to do a new mood board.
James RG Neville: Only if they involve designers, which they don't always do.
Sway Clarke: But most of them do.
James RG Neville: Yeah.
James RG Neville: Okay.
James RG Neville: That's, this is, this is intense.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: So, and then you got that.
Sway Clarke: Cause the AI stuff.
Sway Clarke: I'd like to talk to you about, just totally separately, because that's a different conversation as well.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so out of these, out of the day, I mean, you, I don't know how you keep it all together, but out of this day, what is the, what is the most painful thing that you're doing daily?
Sway Clarke: Like in terms of painful, I mean, takes up the most time, or it's just really the most annoying, you know, like, I just hate this, outside of working till two o'clock in the morning.
James RG Neville: But it's, I think it's when, when I want to progress with the sort of top line macro stuff, like making the mood boards, making a list of past projects as well for the visual researchers to reference.
James RG Neville: Um, that's the stuff that I find I'm the most useful with.
James RG Neville: And when things are stopping me from doing that, like, if I'm getting.
James RG Neville: I'm getting.
James RG Neville: I
James RG Neville: I'm hung up on other issues or having to get sort of more involved in certain aspects of the project than I'd like, or just having like a 1 million messages to endlessly answer where it's like, you know, the, the saying painting the golden gay bridge where you're like, okay, I'm going to respond to all the messages on discord and my emails.
James RG Neville: And by the time you finished, it took so long that there's like a bunch more.
James RG Neville: Um, sometimes I, I've, sometimes I feel like I'm in those loops and I get kind of, I get kind of stressed out because what I should be doing is making this, um, Doing the mood boards in the direction for the actual projects.
Sway Clarke: Like this is kind of the goal, your goal, your, your real goal as a, as an art director.
Sway Clarke: And you define your job is like, I'm supposed to set the direction for these shoots.
Sway Clarke: And my job is to make sure that everybody has this.
Sway Clarke: I got to put this together or have a graphic.
Sway Clarke: So very
Sway Clarke: The put it together and look at it because you don't do them all yourself, but this is like the prime goal.
Sway Clarke: Then there's objective, I guess, and then there's entering Discord messages, entering email messages, entering WhatsApp messages.
Sway Clarke: Is that what you're saying?
Sway Clarke: Yeah, exactly.
James RG Neville: So, I mean, like the traditional sense of an art director is that they're directing the sort of graphic design and the thing.
James RG Neville: And that's kind of what I was hired for, but because of the nature of the industry, it's sort of also keeping an eye on the visuals of it and stuff, which I also like doing.
James RG Neville: I also think I'm like, I'm one of the best people in the company doing AI imagery.
James RG Neville: So that's not something that I dislike doing, although it is at times frustrating and annoying.
James RG Neville: Again, maybe because I want to be able to sit down and do it without distractions.
James RG Neville: But yeah.
James RG Neville: Yeah.
James RG Neville: .
James RG Neville: Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke: Sorry, so we're back to the distractions again, because I want to focus on but I keep getting distracted.
Sway Clarke: I mean, these distractions, how much time are they taking up of like a day, would you say?
Sway Clarke: Like if you were to count the amount of times that you're attending to these emails, these discord messages, like, how much time would you say it takes?
James RG Neville: Well, I guess maybe saying that distractions is a bit unjust because it's my team doing the best they can and asking me questions that they don't know the answers to and that they don't know the answers to.
James RG Neville: So they're not distractions, but just sort of maybe project management stuff.
James RG Neville: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, it's a good, it's a good chunk.
James RG Neville: I would say probably when you factor in the sort of big thump of it in the morning and the big thump of it in the evening, it's like a third of the day.
James RG Neville: The thump of it.
Sway Clarke: So you'd say out of the morning, which is like, I don't know, you'd calculate the morning as five hours, and then the evening is five hours, for example?
James RG Neville: You know, we were talking about, like, I start at 9, 9.30, and I'm generally done doing that big slaughter of it in the morning at 11, so an hour and a half there.
James RG Neville: And then from about six to about nine, there's kind of like a real block of it.
Sway Clarke: And what is the general request?
Sway Clarke: Is it like, hey, I can't find my keys?
Sway Clarke: I don't know how to get into it.
Sway Clarke: Like, what kind of requests are you generally dealing with?
Sway Clarke: Like, what kind of conversations?
James RG Neville: Well, so in the evening, it's like, hey, James, look what I've made you.
James RG Neville: Yeah, I really like, you know, and I also, you know, want to be a good team leader and explain the things.
James RG Neville: I want to explain things I don't like, and it's paid off in dividends doing that, because I think the more I do that, more, even more autonomous people can be, and the more we can, you know, I like, I also like pushing, making treatments.
James RG Neville: want to make better and better treatments.
James RG Neville: So that's kind of, so I say this very, like, trepidly, because I do also, I like being a team leader a lot.
James RG Neville: But it is, it gets a lot on when you've got eight projects, and they're all asking you for stuff.
James RG Neville: Yeah.
James RG Neville: You've got to plan for tomorrow.
James RG Neville: It's a bit, it's a bit horrible.
James RG Neville: I don't know if there's, so I guess maybe distractions is not correct, but.
Sway Clarke: Well, I'll preface this with saying this is, this is like, this is anonymous information.
Sway Clarke: It's not, I'm not going back to Sinbad or Pierre and saying, hey man, let's go.
Sway Clarke: It's not that it's not.
Sway Clarke: It's really like our job here is to discuss the pain.
Sway Clarke: Like, what is it?
Sway Clarke: Like, what are these things?
Sway Clarke: And how do we make these things better?
Sway Clarke: Right?
Sway Clarke: That's the whole point of it.
Sway Clarke: So it's not about a review of your job and how you feel or anything like that.
Sway Clarke: So I understand what you mean when you say distractions.
Sway Clarke: And sorry, I just want to point out, I'm assuming you're saying it's a distraction because you're like, this major thing, like called a mood board, I have to get out.
Sway Clarke: And if I do not get this out, what happens?
Sway Clarke: Right?
Sway Clarke: Like, that's my question is, what happens if a shoot starts from Tuesday morning and there's no mood board?
Sway Clarke: You didn't create it.
Sway Clarke: You just happen to get it done.
Sway Clarke: What happens then?
James RG Neville: The next morning is even worse.
James RG Neville: The next morning amongst also having to say hi to everybody in the morning and go through all of the messages and blah, blah, blah,
James RG Neville: I've also got to make a mood board.
James RG Neville: So I hate being in that situation, which occasionally happens, because sometimes things confirm overnight and you wake up and the job's confirmed and you're like, OK, cool, like now I've got to make this mood board, I've got a plan for the visual research, I've got a plan, everything, plus all the other stuff I've got to do.
James RG Neville: I hate that.
James RG Neville: So that's why I like to do it the night before.
James RG Neville: Does the entire project crumble and fall apart?
James RG Neville: No.
James RG Neville: It just generally means I'm offsetting more work down the line.
James RG Neville: OK.
James RG Neville: Like if I if I don't do a mood board and you just let the kind of the designers to to freestyle it as talented and amazing.
James RG Neville: And they aren't like the the hit.
James RG Neville: rate or the success rate is going to be lower, and it's just going to make more work for future me, or even worse, more work for Zoe, which I don't want to do, because if it comes to the first, like, it's a three-day project, and I didn't make a move, and the design doesn't come back with good feedback, they're like, oh, no, this just doesn't feel right, blah, blah, blah.
Sway Clarke: Ah, okay, because there was no general direction in the first place.
James RG Neville: Yeah, if there was no general, or in some cases, I get it wrong.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah.
James RG Neville: And then, like, the stress level and the workload of the next day is skyrocketed.
James RG Neville: It compiles, okay.
Sway Clarke: And so, one of the things you mentioned in the earlier questionnaire you were saying are responses to bookings, you said something that you've got to constantly wait for,
Sway Clarke: What did you mean by that?
Sway Clarke: Is that information from Madalena and from that team, or is this something else?
James RG Neville: So this is, it occasionally could be from Madalena and co, but not generally.
James RG Neville: So this is normally something I deal with on the weekends when I'm booking, is you're trying to set up a project, but you need to wait for a response from one, two, three of the freelancers, or you need a response from the producer about some information before you can proceed with something.
James RG Neville: So it's a lot of like, you know, I'm ready to go to shoot this email off and connect everybody up and I'm waiting for like...
Sway Clarke: Availabilities if you're going to be booked for the job, information from the producer if it's happening, information about what's happening, where.
James RG Neville: And one that really grinds my gears is, and this is the thing that I don't think...
James RG Neville: Anyone except for Zoe and I understand is that we need to know which of the three platforms that we build treatments in before we can do a mood board because the three platforms are so different that you can't really do like a general mood board for covers all three you mean like Figma versus Figma versus ReadyMag versus InDesign and that's a really big important bit of information that I need to know that isn't often chased or is not even answerable by a producer because they don't know what the difference is.
Sway Clarke: So, and how does that affect your, how does this affect the rest of the whole, you know, what you've got to do after that?
Sway Clarke: Uh, well.
James RG Neville: Well, again, sort of the bottleneck is the making the mood board.
James RG Neville: If I don't know that information, I can't make the mood board.
James RG Neville: And then I don't feel like I've got the project set up correctly.
James RG Neville: So who decides that?
Sway Clarke: Who decides you're using InDesign?
James RG Neville: Good question.
James RG Neville: It's sometimes I think ultimately the producers get to decide because they're the one paying the money.
James RG Neville: But quite often the directors want it one way.
James RG Neville: So sometimes we get in situations where a director always makes treatments in ReadyMag, and then they come to us with a different producer, and there's like a bit of tension there.
James RG Neville: It doesn't happen that often, and normally like if there's any kind of qualm or worry, they are like default InDesign because it's kind of the industry standard.
James RG Neville: And I say, yeah, I've got some, like, diplomatic ways of phrasing it for the direct system and stuff, it expects something different, but, yeah.
Sway Clarke: So it seems like, because I don't want to keep you too, too long, but, I mean, I could probably talk to you forever here, because it's very interesting stuff.
Sway Clarke: But it seems like you mentioned, like, your biggest, like, really biggest annoying pain point is the project management, essentially.
Sway Clarke: Like, you're trying to manage getting your directives done of, like, deliverables to the productions themselves.
Sway Clarke: But then you've got to manage the requests, manage the, not the decisions, but the verification of different content pieces.
Sway Clarke: And then, I guess, just general emails from everybody, right?
Sway Clarke: Does that sound about right?
Sway Clarke: Or is there something that I'm missing?
Sway Clarke: There's one slight...
James RG Neville: Um, thing incorrect with what you said is that I'm not the one who's sending off the deliverables.
James RG Neville: Um, the, so the verification and the tweaking and the commenting, yes, that's, that's what I do.
James RG Neville: But the, the deliverables balls are sent by the freelancers and the visual researchers themselves.
Sway Clarke: Themselves.
Sway Clarke: Ah, okay.
James RG Neville: I get the seal of approval and sometimes I add and help and adjust those deliverables.
James RG Neville: Um, sometimes I'll get on Figma and do some design work.
James RG Neville: Um, hey, Joel, I've made the title page for you.
James RG Neville: Put that in.
James RG Neville: Or sometimes I get involved in the visual research, find some images or make some AI generated images and give those visual research for them to send off.
James RG Neville: But my job is to make sure that everything that comes out of the company is correct to the brief and as good as it can be.
James RG Neville: Okay.
Sway Clarke: I get it now.
Sway Clarke: You're.
Sway Clarke: You're kind of the overseer with your eye of approval.
Sway Clarke: Okay, this is what I think you should do.
Sway Clarke: Okay, and then in between that, you're fielding a lot.
Sway Clarke: And a lot of the requests are coming in through email.
Sway Clarke: Would you say most of them are actually emails or most of them through Discord?
James RG Neville: Client side stuff would always be email, occasionally WhatsApp, company stuff inside Discord.
James RG Neville: Discord.
Sway Clarke: And would you say out of 100, what's the percentage?
Sway Clarke: Like, it's not 50-50, if it's not 50-50, is it 60% are coming through email from the client side?
Sway Clarke: Or is it more like 60% coming from internal through Discord, and I'm mainly on Discord?
James RG Neville: Probably 25, 30% email, 70% Discord.
James RG Neville: Okay.
James RG Neville: The thing is, the 70% in Discord, I like all the people I
James RG Neville: their messages pop up although it can be like I like don't make a tea and I've come back and there's like 15 messages that I need to respond to a bit like um but you know like piecemeal one by one by one I like doing um the ones from the email that I guess they're they're always a bit more stressful because you know like you're like oh like could be bad feedback or something you know they can tell me to do something or last some ridiculous last minute change you know that's that's the one that's always like volatile um but that's again all they're all compiled into that one third of the day up at the top and up at the bottom that you mentioned like no no it's not exclusively not exclusively at all um but um there's a real there's a real there's block of them
Sway Clarke: So would you say, like, out of your role in general, like, in a full day, that maybe, what would you say, I'm trying to think of even the right number, like, a third of your time is this kind of project management, emails, communication, or even more than that, would you say, even, like, what would, if you were to kind of break your day up into a percentage and say, this is the part that I'm actually doing the content, and creating, and doing my AI stuff, and doing this visuals, and versus, this is the, you know, this percentage of it I'm doing, answering emails, and doing all that kind of, like, correspondence and communication.
James RG Neville: I'd probably give an even third split between the correspondence project management stuff, a third doing visual research-based tasks.
James RG Neville: If that's, um, actual visual research or AI image.
Sway Clarke: generation and a third being mood boarding or on-hands design work okay and between the nine between i mean that's a you also have very long days here but i also have four days completely off so our days on okay okay okay and so i'm curious about um you mean you're obviously typing these emails right literally sitting down typing email probably takes you i don't know five or six minutes maybe ten minutes to draft these up send them out um i'm curious about on in your opinion if you had like a magic wand and you could just like cut like have like the perfect solution to like all these problems right or or just can change something about about what you're doing and the way it's been done what would it be
James RG Neville: I was thinking about this before we had on a call, I guess I would like, you know, I really like being available to my entire team at any time.
James RG Neville: But I would like to articulate to them, because I know, you know, teleworking, it's kind of, it's horrible when you send the message off, and like, you don't know if they've read it, or blah blah blah.
James RG Neville: It'd be nice to like, let people know what I'm up to, or something, you know, like, I get really stressed that people are like, waiting on me and stuff.
James RG Neville: Um, because I don't want to be a bottleneck.
James RG Neville: You don't want to be a bottleneck, it?
James RG Neville: No, exactly.
James RG Neville: Exactly.
James RG Neville: So like.
James RG Neville: be bottleneck, you Thank
James RG Neville: When it comes to the evening, I've got eight projects.
James RG Neville: Each project, two freelancers minimum, and they're all sending me something to look at.
James RG Neville: I don't want people to send it off and then they're like, when's James going to look at this?
James RG Neville: It'd nice to be like, hey, you're in some sort of queue or something.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
James RG Neville: Just so people kind of know what I'm up to.
Sway Clarke: And why would this be cool?
Sway Clarke: Why would this be good?
James RG Neville: Because it would remove my stress of people relying on me and feeling like I've abandoned them or something.
James RG Neville: Which might be actually, I'm just like making this complete up, but it is maybe a work insecurity I have.
James RG Neville: And also because I, you know, I would like to be able
James RG Neville: And feel like I couldn't stop for 10 minutes to make a coffee and stuff, I'm really bad at that.
James RG Neville: And you're taking a break for yourself.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, exactly.
Sway Clarke: Does this cause you a lot of stress, this thinking that people are waiting on you, this thinking that you're not attending to all of your different designers fast enough?
James RG Neville: A little bit, but it's also more the fact...
James RG Neville: I think my main stress is thinking that I need to do stuff now, otherwise it gets worse in the future.
James RG Neville: And often when it's responding to freelancers and stuff, I often think if I don't respond to them now, they might spend half an hour doing the wrong thing.
James RG Neville: You know, it's compounded by the fact that I have to do a move before the project starts or like...
James RG Neville: it's have do I'm
James RG Neville: Get up in the morning, make sure everyone's doing the right thing.
James RG Neville: So maybe I just need to be a bit more trusting.
Sway Clarke: Do you find it difficult working by yourself?
Sway Clarke: Like kind of in a silo, you're, you know, in your space, you've got all these things that are happening and then you're sending...
Sway Clarke: Why I'm asking this question is because it sounds like you don't know what's happening with your freelancers.
Sway Clarke: They don't know what's happening with you.
Sway Clarke: You're doing a lot of work, but you're just in your space, right?
Sway Clarke: And there's no, there's not a lot of communication of update of like, okay, this is just, I'm just getting a coffee right now.
Sway Clarke: Or, Hey, I'm just doing this or, Hey, I'm working on this.
Sway Clarke: Like you're saying this Q thing, it sounds like, and maybe I'm wrong, but some kind of like more communication in a way.
Sway Clarke: Not that you don't have discord, but in another way between you and your freelancers and the people you work with, is that, would that sound about right or?
Sway Clarke: That might be accurate.
James RG Neville: Like I have often used in my head.
James RG Neville: bit.
James RG Neville: Let's
James RG Neville: How nice it would be to go to the office and you see everybody.
James RG Neville: And I could like just wander over there and check in on them.
James RG Neville: But obviously that can't happen.
James RG Neville: But I have I have considered that that might be a bit more enjoyable.
James RG Neville: It might be it might be a communication thing.
James RG Neville: does kind of.
James RG Neville: One thing that I did does really worry me is when I send a message and like I don't see that there's been like an emoji put on it or like someone's replied to it.
James RG Neville: Like, I don't know, like I might be like there and be like, hey, did you see this message I wrote?
Sway Clarke: You know?
James RG Neville: So I guess some sort of like validation.
James RG Neville: Yeah, kind of more oversight and like what everybody's doing would be kind of nice.
James RG Neville: But I also don't want to be like overbearing about it.
Sway Clarke: OK, no, interesting.
Sway Clarke: Interesting.
Sway Clarke: But I mean, you do.
Sway Clarke: You do.
Sway Clarke: We everybody on Discord, so you can write a message if you wanted to, right?
James RG Neville: Yeah, and also, like, I know that some people, you know, get heads down and focus on things, and they don't.
James RG Neville: The census is going to end.
Sway Clarke: I don't know if, is there anything else particular that you want to?
Sway Clarke: I'm going to send you a quick link, just very quick.
Sway Clarke: It's not going to be too long.
Sway Clarke: Just let me give you another.
Sway Clarke: If I don't get it before it turns up, then I will send it to you.
Sway Clarke: Where's my Google Meet?
Sway Clarke: I can put it in here.
Sway Clarke: Let me see if I can beat the clock.
Sway Clarke: Okay, here.
Sway Clarke: I'll send this to you right now.
Sway Clarke: In the chat.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, what the   is that?
Sway Clarke: you.
Sway Clarke: Uh oh.
Sway Clarke: Alright.
