Sway Clarke: I can't believe it.
Sway Clarke: I'm joking.
Sway Clarke: I'm joking.
Sway Clarke: How are you doing?
Sway Clarke: I'm doing okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: I had terrible insomnia yesterday, so I'm a bit still...
Leonor Zuzarte: You know that feeling when you wake up and you're doing things and still you feel like half of you is asleep somehow?
Sway Clarke: Yes.
Sway Clarke: That's exactly how I feel today.
Sway Clarke: How are you?
Sway Clarke: I'm good.
Sway Clarke: I've got two kids, so I get that all the time.
Sway Clarke: No, I'm good.
Sway Clarke: I'm good.
Sway Clarke: I'm really good, actually.
Sway Clarke: Yay!
Sway Clarke: I sympathize with parents.
Leonor Zuzarte: I had a migraine for the first time in my life like a few weeks ago.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah.
Leonor Zuzarte: And my partner, like I went into my room, right, because I was not being able to stand anything.
Leonor Zuzarte: The sound of feet or like the smell of food like five meters away.
Leonor Zuzarte: Oh.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I was in my bed.
Leonor Zuzarte: My partner was here and...
Leonor Zuzarte: my living room like eating his food watching a video at a very reasonable volume and I just remember yelling to him like can you put on headphones my head's gonna explode and my first thought was of my mother who had migraines when I was a kid and we used to live in this like double duplex house duplex apartment and she would yell from upstairs like can you guys put those  cartoon voices any lower please I'm begging and as a kid I remember thinking there's no way she can hear that now you know now you know well look we got we've got 45 minutes and I don't want to take a few time you know it's not um so I just just so we can stay on schedule uh so again like this is this is not a review right this is just trying to figure out
Sway Clarke: So, what's working, what's not working, you know, what's stealing your time, essentially.
Sway Clarke: That's what I'm trying to figure out here.
Sway Clarke: So, what I would love for you to do is walk me through a bit of, and so I just have notes here, right?
Sway Clarke: I've got things that I would like to ask you and I'm just writing stuff down, but I'd like you to walk me through like a typical week, you know, like from Monday morning, you come in the office or you start at your computer and like walk me through what happens, how it works.
Sway Clarke: What do you do?
Sway Clarke: Okay, so Monday.
Leonor Zuzarte: Monday, what I would do usually is I would log on.
Leonor Zuzarte: I would have a quick overview of what happened in the weekend.
Leonor Zuzarte: And then my first thought on a Monday morning is Tuesday morning, we have a little meeting that we call the HR review.
Sway Clarke: So I start working.
Leonor Zuzarte: I'm on anything that has to do with that.
Leonor Zuzarte: That usually includes revising a little bit of my own admin to make sure that everything is more or less in place.
Leonor Zuzarte: I have this, like, not practical at all sheet that I call the newbie tracker, which is where I input every week what projects the newbies were on, who were the seniors on those projects, and how did they react.
Leonor Zuzarte: Usually I'm not really good at kind of, like, spreading tasks out throughout the week because I forget it's not.
Leonor Zuzarte: So usually Monday is the day where I will reach out to those seniors and be like, hey, how are you?
Leonor Zuzarte: I'd love to know how so-and-so did on this project for every newbie, for every senior.
Leonor Zuzarte: After that, I usually have, like, a couple of calls because some go
Leonor Zuzarte: Sometimes people feel really cornered, giving feedback.
Leonor Zuzarte: No, no, no, no, no, no, our team, I work mostly within the confines of like, what's our team.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: If I'm talking to a producer, it's because they've been, well, it's because either someone's on holiday, which was yesterday, or like, they've been unpleasant towards someone.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: But sometimes, like, within the team, because our structure is new person assists established person, established person gives feedback, because the art directors themselves don't even really, kind of, the art directors themselves seem more of like, end product types.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah.
Leonor Zuzarte: So they're not the best at keeping track for this, like, very specific onboarding progress?
Leonor Zuzarte: And to there's just
Leonor Zuzarte: And some people, their job is not to give feedback to each other, obviously.
Leonor Zuzarte: Some of them get like, what if I called you?
Leonor Zuzarte: And I'm like, of course.
Sway Clarke: So you do the feedback, you get the feedback from the senior worker on the junior worker.
Sway Clarke: That's every Monday or is that every day?
Leonor Zuzarte: I usually try to do them every Monday because it's easier for me, because if I go about doing it every day, I feel like it's one of those things where I wouldn't do anything.
Sway Clarke: Exactly.
Sway Clarke: Exactly.
Sway Clarke: OK, so you go, you get the feedback and then that I put it in my little sheet and then that's done.
Leonor Zuzarte: And then I start looking at the week ahead in our calendar and I try to discuss kind of with the booking team.
Leonor Zuzarte: what is like what we can do moving ahead.
Leonor Zuzarte: So, because usually when I get feedback, I'm also very aware that these people exist, and I'll go and I'm like, hey, could we maybe get this person to hop on this project if it confirms, or hey, could we give more assists to this newbie or that newbie or whatever it is.
Sway Clarke: You have an idea of who's done a good job, who's doing well, who's not, so let's move this person around or recommendation.
Sway Clarke: So that's where you kind of start working with the booking department to say like, okay, I can actually see that.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, if like for some reason, because booking is so, like it's very quick, and it can be a bit much, sometimes I'm kind of like the, I don't know, I hold the line a little bit to be like, hey, so let's imagine.
Leonor Zuzarte: Maria did three assists this month, but Louise did none.
Leonor Zuzarte: month.
Leonor Zuzarte: with booking Maria We assistants, able get
Leonor Zuzarte: We need to, we need to get Louise on these projects.
Sway Clarke: Otherwise we won't, we won't keep her.
Sway Clarke: And then, so what happens after that?
Sway Clarke: So then you coordinate with the booking and that's your, what, midday now?
Sway Clarke: Mid, of the day now, you would say?
Sway Clarke: then, yeah, I would.
Leonor Zuzarte: Then what happens?
Leonor Zuzarte: Well, to be fair, let's say it's middle of the day.
Leonor Zuzarte: I will keep getting feedback throughout my day, which is, well, if you've got ADHD like me, it can be disrupting.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: But, what happens then?
Leonor Zuzarte: Then I try and kind of like, make sure that the feedback that I'm getting is in its proper place.
Leonor Zuzarte: And then, depends.
Sway Clarke: I.
Sway Clarke: I.
Leonor Zuzarte: I feel like I'm doing a really bad job at outlining my job, but I did used to make these kind of like weekly goals lists, so let me, let me go over like a regular week.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay, so then it would kind of depend on where we are, kind of like in the onboarding cycle, because if, if we are kind of where we are right now, then I'm looking at people that are trying to get in.
Leonor Zuzarte: Because I've already gotten some of the people in.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay, you mean new freelancers getting them into working?
Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah.
Leonor Zuzarte: So they've done all of the steps, they've done the interviews, they've done the assessments, they've done, they've been onboarded, and now they're working, right?
Sway Clarke: You're doing all of that process?
Leonor Zuzarte: I'm logistically supporting all of that process.
Sway Clarke: Okay, but you're not doing the interviews and all that kind of stuff.
Sway Clarke: No, so Pierre does interviews.
Leonor Zuzarte: I basically, like, I logistically support.
Leonor Zuzarte: That's the best way to put it.
Leonor Zuzarte: So when people reach out, I'm the first point of contact.
Leonor Zuzarte: I'm kind of the person that's like, hey, Pierre's gonna send you a link to his calendar within, like, the week.
Leonor Zuzarte: Or like, hey, we're not really onboarding right now, but I will keep your details on file so that I can reach out to you when we are.
Leonor Zuzarte: And these come through the website?
Sway Clarke: Like, through the website?
Sway Clarke: Or where do these come through?
Sway Clarke: Usually our email.
Sway Clarke: They come through the website.
Leonor Zuzarte: They come a lot through personal recommendation.
Leonor Zuzarte: That makes sense.
Leonor Zuzarte: So it's a healthy mixture of, like, our general hello at AMBUSHED email and, like, mine and Pierre's.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: Mostly because a lot of people are like, so who can I email about this?
Leonor Zuzarte: I'm like, me and Pierre.
Leonor Zuzarte: Always, there's no need.
Sway Clarke: So you work a lot with everybody, like you work with Pierre, and then you work a lot with Alison and Madalena with the side of things.
Sway Clarke: And so, okay, I get it with the kind of the deal that I'm care of the community.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: And so you mentioned something about like rates and stuff like this before, like, is this a part of your weekly thing?
Sway Clarke: Or is this more of a monthly thing?
Leonor Zuzarte: It depends, really.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's a weekly discussion usually because, well, because we tend to kind of like, I don't know, do them in groups.
Leonor Zuzarte: Like it's very seldom that I will kind of like have an HR call and we will be like, let's raise this one person.
Leonor Zuzarte: And that won't lead to, uh, oh, but if.
Leonor Zuzarte: we're raising them, have we thought about raising this other person?
Leonor Zuzarte: And who's the call with, Pierre?
Leonor Zuzarte: This call is with Pierre, with the art director on duty, the assistant art director on duty, and the booking team.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Sway Clarke: The amount of money that they make hourly or daily, raising their hourly rate, okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: I would say it happens bi-weekly to kind of like average it out.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Leonor Zuzarte: Because it focuses on different aspects and we may or may not have like requests.
Leonor Zuzarte: So for instance, last week we had requests from two team members that wanted to see their rates go up and they wanted to.
Leonor Zuzarte: Usually people are really nice about it.
Leonor Zuzarte: usually like, you know, look, these are the reasons that I think like, this is the progress that I've made.
Leonor Zuzarte: This is what we had discussed me getting better at.
Leonor Zuzarte: This is why I think that I'm like solid.
Leonor Zuzarte: I am looking to get to this amount.
Leonor Zuzarte: If you feel like that's not where we are yet, I would love to get some, like, insight on how to get there.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: And so I just want to make sure that I have a good sense of your role overview.
Sway Clarke: So it's kind of like getting feedback from the team about new on-boarders or new freelancers on Monday, trying to get, like, a weekly review or maybe a weekend review of what happened, what's been going on, and you're doing that through Discord, you're doing that through email, you're doing that through, okay, just reading through email.
Leonor Zuzarte: Mostly through Discord or WhatsApp.
Leonor Zuzarte: I tend to WhatsApp for feedback, because I, like, pile up a whole week's worth of projects on a Monday, and that makes it so that
Leonor Zuzarte: that a lot of the people that work during the week are not necessarily working that Monday, which means that in my brain and in reality, they would not have to check their Discord.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so you just get going with WhatsApp.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, I just go to the platform that's familiar.
Leonor Zuzarte: I don't know if that makes sense.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, no, no, no.
Sway Clarke: I mean, go to do what's easy, right?
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: Okay, sorry, sorry.
Leonor Zuzarte: No, it's easier and it's what they are more sure to answer faster.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so just a quick question.
Sway Clarke: So you're usually using, you said, Discord, WhatsApp, e-mail, and then you're using like Google Sheets.
Sway Clarke: Google Sheets, anything else?
Sway Clarke: Any other programs that you're using?
Sway Clarke: Platforms?
Leonor Zuzarte: Oh, I'm trying to work with Kit at the moment.
Leonor Zuzarte: Kit, that's nice.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's a newsletter platform, but that's because I'm trying to start an AMBUSHED newsletter, and it's kind of my side project, meaning that it's the one that gets like trampled anytime that anything else pops up.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so my next question would be, what frustrates you most about your daily work?
Sway Clarke: About my daily work?
Sway Clarke: And what takes way longer than it should?
Leonor Zuzarte: I would say, what would I say?
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay, so I would say my onboarding master sheet is readable, but I hate it to the point that I tend to avoid it and then have to spend the whole day updating it.
Leonor Zuzarte: Whether that be for people that we're trying to bring in, because that's one of the tabs, one of the tabs is like everyone that contacted us, what they do, whether they've tried, whether they like first contact, or whether they've had like an interview, or whether they're working on their assessment, or whether we're planning to onboard them soon, it's there, and then it's like notes, and then it's like how they did on the test.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I, I hate it so much that I, like, don't know, I think it's because it's a lot of buttons for, like, very little payout.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Does that make sense?
Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah.
Sway Clarke: I mean, well, how, I mean, how often a week are you using?
Sway Clarke: Not often at all.
Leonor Zuzarte: I, this one, I would say that whenever Pierre and I get together, and are like, or whenever Pierre tells me like, hey, I think we're...
Leonor Zuzarte: ...
Leonor Zuzarte: ...
Leonor Zuzarte: I'm ready to onboard again.
Leonor Zuzarte: I'm going to start taking people on interviews.
Leonor Zuzarte: I look back at our onboarding master and I'm like, okay, this is who we have.
Leonor Zuzarte: This is who we've interviewed.
Leonor Zuzarte: This is who we've kept, like, who reached out.
Leonor Zuzarte: This is what their profile looks like.
Leonor Zuzarte: So, essentially, I tend to do it once for every onboarding cycle.
Leonor Zuzarte: And then, while we're onboarding, I keep updating it pretty regularly.
Leonor Zuzarte: But that's because Pierre also keeps sending me messages like, hey, talk to so-and-so.
Leonor Zuzarte: Let's send them the test.
Leonor Zuzarte: Or, hey, talk to so-and-so.
Leonor Zuzarte: They don't really have the experience.
Leonor Zuzarte: Let's say no thank you.
Sway Clarke: Can you use this maybe once a month, I guess?
Sway Clarke: You really go into it?
Sway Clarke: Would you say once a month, every two months, every three months?
Leonor Zuzarte: I would say I really, like, I try to update it weekly with people that reach out because we do get people, like, reaching out weekly.
Leonor Zuzarte: And that's, like, kind of the easiest part, right?
Leonor Zuzarte: Just...
Leonor Zuzarte: Name, contact, first contact, what they do, who recommended them or whatever.
Leonor Zuzarte: Whenever Pierre's like, hey, let's have a look at the people next week, I go into it deeper.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I really like, I go over their CVs, I go over their portfolios, I point out kind of like what benefits they might bring.
Leonor Zuzarte: So like, you know, they seem extra motivated, or they have a lot of experience working with agencies, or they work on our preferred design platforms, or whatever it is that makes that person stand out.
Leonor Zuzarte: But I only do that for every onboarding cycle.
Leonor Zuzarte: So like every month, two months.
Sway Clarke: And how much time does it take up when you do it every, every month?
Sway Clarke: Are talking a couple of hours?
Sway Clarke: Are you talking a couple of minutes?
Sway Clarke: Are talking a couple of...
Leonor Zuzarte: I would say a couple of hours to like, half my day?
Leonor Zuzarte: A couple of hours to half your day?
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: that's again, my, I tend to cadence things that I don't...
Leonor Zuzarte: I don't necessarily like to do because I think they're boring into like a day where I have to do them and so I get a bit anxious that I've missed any details so besides doing the things I always go back to the emails and make sure that like all of the things are there.
Leonor Zuzarte: Does that make sense?
Sway Clarke: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so and what, I kind of want to come back to that.
Sway Clarke: want to see is there anything else?
Sway Clarke: What else is for you is like super frustrating or just, you're like, oh, I just, too much time.
Leonor Zuzarte: I don't like that we have to update the rates on the team directory and the FCA.
Leonor Zuzarte: Even though that's just two steps.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's more often than not that I'll be like, oh, I raised this person.
Leonor Zuzarte: Did I not?
Leonor Zuzarte: And then like one sheet says one thing and the other maybe doesn't.
Leonor Zuzarte: But I don't know how much of this is like a really weird conversation sometimes to have because it's like, how much of this is like a systems issue?
Leonor Zuzarte: How much of it is like personal failing to be determined?
Sway Clarke: I think it more depends on like, how often does this happen?
Sway Clarke: Like, how often in a week do you do?
Sway Clarke: How often do you use this rates?
Sway Clarke: Like, how often do you do this?
Sway Clarke: Right?
Sway Clarke: How often do you change rates?
Sway Clarke: And how long does it take when you do them?
Sway Clarke: Like, that's my first question with anything that you're doing.
Sway Clarke: It doesn't take a long time.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's usually more so that it's a little bit chaotic because I tend to, when I'm, when I have to raise people, I tend to raise them in like a day because I get really, because I want to talk to them.
Leonor Zuzarte: So that's my own, like, that's me being my own way.
Leonor Zuzarte: But I like to talk to people via a call.
Leonor Zuzarte: Take me through this.
Sway Clarke: You, how, okay.
Sway Clarke: So with a,
Sway Clarke: With a rate change, you will get on a call with someone to talk about putting their rate up.
Sway Clarke: So you have to call this person, and the calls usually last about how long?
Sway Clarke: Like 10 minutes?
Sway Clarke: Like half an hour.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so half an hour.
Sway Clarke: And so you have these calls how often a month?
Sway Clarke: It really depends.
Leonor Zuzarte: There was a time where we were like, let's review everyone's rate, and I had like a week of calls.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so then you would have like, for each call, about a half an hour.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: Depending on how many calls you had, like, well, how many people you were raising that month, 30 minutes, you would say, or sorry, half an hour per call, right?
Sway Clarke: But that's, and then within that, you also have the actual, you go into these systems, you have to go into your, what did you say?
Sway Clarke: Your team directory and your FCA and make the changes to the system.
Sway Clarke: And how long does that take?
Sway Clarke: Like, let's just say for one, like per person.
Sway Clarke: That's
Leonor Zuzarte: Per person, I would say like five minutes, not even.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay, it will take you five minutes.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's more of a question that things bleed into each other for me.
Leonor Zuzarte: For example?
Sway Clarke: Let's say I'm raising you, right?
Leonor Zuzarte: We're on a call.
Leonor Zuzarte: I told you the good news.
Leonor Zuzarte: We're both very happy.
Leonor Zuzarte: I take a chance and I ask you like kind of how you feel about your work so far.
Leonor Zuzarte: If there are any things that you'd like to see done differently from our end.
Leonor Zuzarte: How could we best support you as well?
Leonor Zuzarte: You know, kind of like highlights, lowlights, that kind of stuff.
Leonor Zuzarte: And then I go, we end our call.
Leonor Zuzarte: I email you kind of like formalizing the rate.
Leonor Zuzarte: So like, hey, Sway, thank you so much for hopping on that call with me.
Leonor Zuzarte: As we discussed, your rate from now on will be XYZ.
Leonor Zuzarte: And then I go into the team directory and I input your new rate.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I input the information, like, raised to 20 euros per hour on 27th of Jan.
Leonor Zuzarte: And by the time that I'm like, OK, let me update the FCA, maybe I have to get on another call.
Leonor Zuzarte: And then, you know what I mean?
Sway Clarke: OK, so that's not even just, it's not even just automated, I mean, sorry, in one place.
Sway Clarke: You have to go to two different sheets to do this, yeah?
Sway Clarke: And what happens, like, if this goes wrong?
Sway Clarke: Like, what if there are errors in this?
Sway Clarke: Oh, we usually find them and correct them.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's not really a problem because the freelancers will upkeep their own timesheets.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah.
Leonor Zuzarte: And.
Leonor Zuzarte: Sorry, who finds the errors?
Sway Clarke: You have to go back in and look at the errors.
Sway Clarke: How do we find it?
Sway Clarke: How do you find out that there are even errors if something was erroneous?
Sway Clarke: Let's say that I raised someone and I forget to update the FCA.
Leonor Zuzarte: So in our dashboard, they're earning 17 an hour.
Leonor Zuzarte: But in reality, they're earning a.
Leonor Zuzarte: The booking team will find it because they're the ones that do invoicing.
Leonor Zuzarte: So either Madalena or Elise will be getting someone's hours and they'll be like, that person's charging is 18.5, but the dashboard says 17.
Leonor Zuzarte: And usually they'll message me and be like, hey, did you raise this person?
Sway Clarke: So they have to message you to find out there's a call or there's a message or there's an email saying, hey, I found a discrepancy, what's up with this?
Sway Clarke: And then you've got to respond, because this is all time, right?
Sway Clarke: So this is, so then you've got to respond.
Leonor Zuzarte: And then I look and I'm like, oh, hey, yeah, I did update the rate in the team directory.
Leonor Zuzarte: Let me look at the FCA really quick.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: And so how long does that take for that process and how often does it happen?
Sway Clarke: It doesn't happen that often.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Once a year you have this kind of discrepancy?
Sway Clarke: No, I would say like once every three months, once every three months, the discrepancy and then it takes you, what, like maybe 10 minutes to sort it out.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: And yeah, it's it's fairly it's fairly easy.
Leonor Zuzarte: OK, yeah, it's not it's just it might happen, but it's caught fairly quickly as well because we're not going to invoice for the project without looking at the team members hours.
Leonor Zuzarte: And so as soon as we look, if there's a different amount between like what they're saying they made and what the dashboard is telling us that they're making, even if you don't immediately see like, oh, they're changing, they're charging differently.
Leonor Zuzarte: You're like the total in the sheet is like 500 and then the total in the dash is like 400 something.
Leonor Zuzarte: You're like, oh, this is not.
Leonor Zuzarte: And then you look.
Sway Clarke: And so this is where Alice or Madalena kind of get this information, and they're like, uh-oh, I got a problem, now I gotta go do some work and go figure this out, I guess, so to speak.
Sway Clarke: And then you'll get an update that it's been updated, that there was something erroneous that happened.
Sway Clarke: Yes.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so the rate change affects Madalena and Alice and even, I guess, Sinbad, if he's also doing reviews of the invoices.
Sway Clarke: So this can, this does have like another effect, right?
Sway Clarke: I'm trying to, I'm just trying to understand like who else is.
Sway Clarke: No, definitely.
Leonor Zuzarte: I think Sinbad, it's different with Sinbad, but that's just because sometimes, Sinbad is not usually on the HR calls.
Leonor Zuzarte: And so sometimes he's not so much on, kind of like...
Leonor Zuzarte: Because him and Pierre take turns, I don't know if they told you this, they take turns kind of like in their overseeing or like shifting their focus towards AMBUSHED primarily, so sometimes Simbad will be used to someone having a certain rate and their rate will change and he'll be like, hey, did we raise this person?
Leonor Zuzarte: And I'll be like, hey, yes, we did.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: And so you mentioned, so you mentioned the onboarding master sheet, which you hate, which because it's just a mess, I guess.
Sway Clarke: It's not a mess.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's that I made it so that it would be an excruciating detail and filling it out is a bore.
Leonor Zuzarte: Ah, okay.
Sway Clarke: And is all this information even necessary, do you find?
Sway Clarke: I get the sense that you find that you've put it over.
Sway Clarke: Okay, it is all necessary.
Leonor Zuzarte: is to me, especially because the onboarding master has two main functions, which is people that we're trying to get into Ambushed, and that part's really useful.
Leonor Zuzarte: And it's really useful that it's in excruciating detail because we don't always move people in at the time that they reach out.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: So it's really useful to be able to look at it after, like, having an application that came in, like, a month ago, two months ago, even.
Sway Clarke: If, once this, just really quickly, I don't want spend too much time, but if the onboarding process is that you're getting new freelancers that come in, and you'd probably say, how many freelancers new you get a month?
Sway Clarke: Like, five?
Sway Clarke: Five freelancers a month?
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: Do you average it out?
Sway Clarke: Five or ten?
Sway Clarke: Or is it more like 20?
Sway Clarke: No, no, no.
Leonor Zuzarte: I would say, like, five, but I can actually...
Leonor Zuzarte: I have a little applications tab.
Sway Clarke: And while you do that, I'll ask the next part of my question, which is for the process of like you have to do an interview and then you have to get this information.
Sway Clarke: You get this information and you have to put the information into this sheet.
Sway Clarke: And how long does it take you to put the information into the sheet and where do you get the information from?
Leonor Zuzarte: OK, so after the interview, the information will usually come from Pierre in an email, in an email.
Leonor Zuzarte: It will either be an email or a message, but usually Pierre only messages if someone's like extraordinary and he wants to be like, let's get them in now.
Leonor Zuzarte: In that case, he'll message me and be like, hey, Leo, just talked with this person.
Leonor Zuzarte: They're great.
Leonor Zuzarte: Let's like steamboat this one and then you'll read through the email, take all of that information and put it into your sheet.
Sway Clarke: your onboarding sheet.
Sway Clarke: Yes.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: And that process takes you roughly how long?
Sway Clarke: Like five minutes?
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, I'd say.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Sway Clarke: It takes you five minutes.
Leonor Zuzarte: to ten, depending on how specific Pierre's email is, because sometimes Pierre is just like, let's send them the test.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I'm like, I have no idea how this interview went or what this person is like, but I can send them the test.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Sway Clarke: And so then we get to just, I mean, you mentioned, you mentioned, onboarding, mentioned, uh, the rates, the rate, the rate filling rates, and it's not on both sheets and kind of going back and forth.
Sway Clarke: And is there anything else other than those two things that you would say are like, you're frustrating, like you just like, I'd rather not do this, or this takes way too much of my time, or I just hate it.
Sway Clarke: Or it doesn't work.
Leonor Zuzarte: Hmm.
Leonor Zuzarte: Hmm.
Leonor Zuzarte: Hmm.
Leonor Zuzarte: Hmm.
Leonor Zuzarte: Hmm.
Leonor Zuzarte: I'm trying to think.
Leonor Zuzarte: There's one thing that I particularly don't like, but I don't think it's necessarily changeable, which is we do sanitizing, which is the process of getting our projects anonymized enough so that we can share them.
Leonor Zuzarte: Does that make sense?
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, like replacing all proprietary information like text, keeping the bare bones of the structure, the pictures and erasing the director and the production company, stuff like that.
Leonor Zuzarte: That's just but that's, I think, a personal disliking rather than a system that failure.
Leonor Zuzarte: But it is something that I don't like doing, which is like.
Leonor Zuzarte: Gathering which project.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah,
Leonor Zuzarte: Which should be sanitized to what ends should they be sanitized and kind of moving on from there.
Leonor Zuzarte: So, for instance, we really have been getting a few more done because we really need to make some new portfolios for some of our team members.
Leonor Zuzarte: And that process to me is awful.
Leonor Zuzarte: Like, I just I don't like it.
Sway Clarke: What kind of awful?
Sway Clarke: Like how often how often do you do this process?
Sway Clarke: How often are doing this?
Sway Clarke: Not often enough.
Leonor Zuzarte: We should be doing it like ideally in my head.
Leonor Zuzarte: We should be doing it like once every three months.
Sway Clarke: Once every three months to do a full sanitizing of the last three months of work.
Sway Clarke: No.
Leonor Zuzarte: So of projects that we need sanitized.
Leonor Zuzarte: So it's either it was an exceptional project and we would like to have it sanitized so that we can like throw it to clients know.
Leonor Zuzarte: can always I love that.
Leonor Zuzarte: impossible.
Leonor Zuzarte: We...
Leonor Zuzarte: Get it for a future website update or something like that.
Sway Clarke: Would you say that out of the three things you mentioned to me, this is the most, like, the biggest pain for you, or would you say one of the other, this one?
Leonor Zuzarte: I would say this is the biggest pain for me because it doesn't tie into any of my other work.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Walk me through a bit of this.
Sway Clarke: So you said that every three months you're going to have to, like, go through, look at all these projects that you did, and determine if they should be sanitized, or does somebody tell you that these are the ones Okay, so that's something that I pushed so that it would be other people that tell me.
Leonor Zuzarte: I don't, like, I'm not on the ground building treatments.
Leonor Zuzarte: I'm not looking at most of our treatments, to be honest with you.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: I really, so I really don't feel like I'm the one who's going to be like...
Leonor Zuzarte: Hey, let's sanitize this.
Leonor Zuzarte: And it used to be that Maddalena had a better grasp on this.
Leonor Zuzarte: But when I moved into my position, it kind of, she kind of asked me if I could kind of like coordinate, because sanitizing is also a task that we can ask kind of like newer people to do.
Sway Clarke: Newer freelancers?
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, because it's a good learning exercise.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's a very boring task in the sense that you go into an already existing project, you replace the text, you do the things.
Leonor Zuzarte: So it's not necessarily very creative, but it is a good kind of like gateway into seeing kind of like the level that the work we're most proud of, or the work that we want to showcase for a certain freelancer is at.
Leonor Zuzarte: And so it is a good like.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: How long does it take per sanitization?
Sway Clarke: I would say like up to three hours.
Leonor Zuzarte: Up to three hours for one, right?
Sway Clarke: Yes.
Sway Clarke: And that's going into what, like a PowerPoint or like a Figma or like one of these kind of where the project lives, and then you have to pull out, literally pull out the information off of it, right?
Sway Clarke: Pull out this, pull out the title, pull out the brand, pull out this, okay.
Sway Clarke: Pull out the producer's name.
Sway Clarke: And then you got to get it ready to be given to who?
Sway Clarke: Who gets this now?
Sway Clarke: Who does this go to when it's done?
Sway Clarke: Who does this get handed over to, Pierre or to Sinbad?
Sway Clarke: No, it gets handed over to me.
Leonor Zuzarte: Ah, okay.
Sway Clarke: So they do it for you?
Leonor Zuzarte: I insert the links.
Leonor Zuzarte: So we publish all of our treatments online.
Leonor Zuzarte: Like all of them are online presentations.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah.
Leonor Zuzarte: So the person doing the sanitizing will essentially have to duplicate the project.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: Clean all of the things and republish.
Leonor Zuzarte: And they send me the new published link and I go and I put the new published link wherever it needs to live.
Leonor Zuzarte: So usually that's the project directory.
Leonor Zuzarte: And if we're doing portfolios, which we are doing now, it's on the portfolio sheet.
Leonor Zuzarte: Another sheet.
Leonor Zuzarte: Another sheet.
Sway Clarke: So, so, so, so if you are, if you are, if it takes three hours to do this, to do one sanitization of a project and you're overlooking it, that means how much time of your time is spent on this, on each sanitizing?
Sway Clarke: Like, do you have to review it or something?
Sway Clarke: Like, and so how much time of your personal time is being spent per?
Sway Clarke: Per sanitizing?
Sway Clarke: Per sanitizing.
Sway Clarke: sanitizing.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: So usually I would say there's a gap of time that I don't know how much.
Leonor Zuzarte: should...
Leonor Zuzarte: where I'm like, let's say we need portfolios.
Leonor Zuzarte: Let's pick up on our last example.
Leonor Zuzarte: What I'll do is I'll kind of like go over the last projects that this person did because it's for their portfolio, right?
Leonor Zuzarte: And I'll gather those projects and I'll put those projects in the portfolio sheet and I'll be like, hey, guys, have a look.
Leonor Zuzarte: Tell me which projects you feel like are worthy of being on the portfolio and which projects we don't need to care about.
Leonor Zuzarte: And so then like the art directors, sometimes Pierre or Simbad will have a look and they'll leave comments like, oh, this I don't think is good enough.
Leonor Zuzarte: This looks great.
Leonor Zuzarte: I like the V1 for this better than the V final.
Leonor Zuzarte: Could we sanitize that?
Leonor Zuzarte: Stuff like that.
Leonor Zuzarte: And so then I come back in and I gather the treatments that we've established need sanitizing.
Leonor Zuzarte: I make a list.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I look at who I have that I could send them as a sanitizing mission to.
Leonor Zuzarte: Once I have that, so kind of like project assigned to freelancer, I usually send like six per person so that it's, you know, so that it's also worth their time because it's their shorter projects.
Leonor Zuzarte: They don't equate like one sanitizing is not a full day of work.
Sway Clarke: So I'm going to jump in at points, but how much are you sending like six to each?
Sway Clarke: So let's you say you're doing this every three months.
Sway Clarke: I'm saying I'm trying to, but yes.
Sway Clarke: OK, you try to do this every three months and then every three months you're going to call up like how many free freelancers are you calling?
Sway Clarke: Are you doing giving six each?
Sway Clarke: I mean, is it like two or is it like ten or is it?
Sway Clarke: Depends.
Sway Clarke: Depends.
Sway Clarke: It's so.
Leonor Zuzarte: Between two and three, I would say.
Leonor Zuzarte: Freelancers.
Sway Clarke: Yes.
Sway Clarke: Six jobs each.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, because it also depends on how many projects we need.
Leonor Zuzarte: So, for instance, we had a big onboarding wave last year.
Leonor Zuzarte: That means that now I need all of these people to have a portfolio.
Leonor Zuzarte: Does that make sense?
Sway Clarke: Yeah, the freelancers want their portfolio.
Sway Clarke: They're like, hey, I did all this work.
Sway Clarke: I want some resume of things that I've worked on, for example, right?
Leonor Zuzarte: It's more the other way around.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's more so producers want to know who we're suggesting for their team.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: So I'll get you an example.
Leonor Zuzarte: Harry joined our team last year.
Leonor Zuzarte: He's moved fairly quickly into a place where we're now having him lead projects.
Leonor Zuzarte: And so that means that whenever the booking team is talking to a producer and is like, oh, oh, and we'd like to suggest Harry to to do.
Leonor Zuzarte: Visual research, the producer will usually be like, oh, and can we see some of Harry's work?
Leonor Zuzarte: And we don't have a portfolio for Harry at the moment, so we kind of have to go and get, like, individual projects that maybe are sanitized to kind of, like, show off.
Sway Clarke: How important is this in the sense of, like, what happens if you don't get these done?
Sway Clarke: Like, what if you went for, like, six months or eight months and you just didn't get these sanitizing done?
Leonor Zuzarte: It makes it so that the booking team's life is much harder.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: Because they have to then verbally argue for our freelancer rather than just being, like, and for visual research, we'd like to suggest Harry hyperlink.
Sway Clarke: Okay, and then they don't have anything to back it up.
Sway Clarke: So this becomes a problem for Alice and Madalena at that point.
Sway Clarke: And is this a priority for you?
Sway Clarke: Like, is this something that within your role is, like, hey, we've got to make sure we get this done?
Sway Clarke: Is anybody...
Sway Clarke: Is there pressure on you to do this?
Sway Clarke: Or is this just something you know you have to do because the producers need it and Madalena and Alice need it?
Sway Clarke: No, there is some pressure, I would say.
Sway Clarke: Especially from Madalena.
Leonor Zuzarte: I think that because it was so unlike anything else that I'd done before, in the sense that my usual tasks would not be this.
Leonor Zuzarte: And it's one of those things where it kind of like became a priority because we let so much of it pile up.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Leonor Zuzarte: So at the moment, it is definitely a priority for me.
Leonor Zuzarte: How many do you have right now that you think you need to do?
Sway Clarke: Oh, a lot.
Leonor Zuzarte: So I've had one freelancer sanitize 10 treatments over the break.
Leonor Zuzarte: Right.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I still have, like, how much.
Leonor Zuzarte: So.
Leonor Zuzarte: One, two, three, one, two, three, four, five, so like around eight people that need new portfolios, each portfolio has between four to six treatments.
Leonor Zuzarte: So let's say we're aiming at six per portfolio.
Leonor Zuzarte: That's a total of 48 treatments, so I'm 38 treatments behind.
Leonor Zuzarte: Does that make sense?
Sway Clarke: Yeah, and each of these take three hours.
Sway Clarke: And each of those take three hours.
Leonor Zuzarte: That's the beautiful part of it is that those three hours are none of my business.
Sway Clarke: Well, they're three hours from your freelancers, but there are three hours that you're paying for, right?
Sway Clarke: Yes.
Sway Clarke: So the company is still paying for that, and how much do you pay a freelancer an hour to do that roughly?
Sway Clarke: It depends.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay.
Leonor Zuzarte: depends on the freelancer.
Leonor Zuzarte: It used to be so that we would pay around 25 euros per treatment, but freelancers kind of reached out to me and they were like, listen, this is like, I'm not saying that it, you know, that I, whatever, but it's like, it's not enough money.
Leonor Zuzarte: Like it's a boring task and it requires like attention to detail and concentration and whatever.
Leonor Zuzarte: So how much are you paying now?
Leonor Zuzarte: We're paying whatever their hourly rate is.
Leonor Zuzarte: Sorry.
Leonor Zuzarte: I have construction, apparently.
Leonor Zuzarte: No worries.
Sway Clarke: Just to get an average because you have some that are newbies, some that are more, more, but what would be the middle ground of like a pay?
Sway Clarke: Would you say per hour are you paying?
Sway Clarke: Like, is it 15?
Sway Clarke: Middle ground would be 17.
Leonor Zuzarte: So for instance, Desiree that sanitized over the break, she's at 20.
Leonor Zuzarte: Any, any newbie that comes in, I would tell them to charge 15 per hour.
Leonor Zuzarte: Because that's kind of like our minimum rate, so I'd say middle ground would be around 18.
Sway Clarke: And just so I'm clear, so of these 38, I'm trying to also get a sense of what's your time spent relative to each one of these?
Sway Clarke: Like how much time do you spend coordinating or reviewing or, you know what I mean, per one of these?
Sway Clarke: Per project?
Sway Clarke: Per, per, not proposal, per, my proposal, what Permission.
Sway Clarke: But what are we looking at?
Sway Clarke: We have to get these, the sanitized, what are we sanitizing again?
Sway Clarke: Sorry?
Sway Clarke: We're sanitizing projects.
Sway Clarke: Yeah, the treatment, sorry.
Sway Clarke: So the treatment, sanitization, how much, you have 38 of them, but I'm trying to understand 38 38 of them are the three hours each, which is the...
Sway Clarke: money that's being spent to the intern or to the freelancers.
Sway Clarke: But what is your time spent per treatment?
Sway Clarke: Like, you're not doing it yourself, but you do have some involvement with it.
Sway Clarke: So you're saying like, for every treatment, it takes me five minutes to sort, to go review it, to look at it, to find it.
Sway Clarke: Ten minutes, half an hour.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay, so I would say it takes a bit more.
Leonor Zuzarte: It takes like, I would say minimum an hour or a couple of hours in between, like looking for projects, selecting projects, setting up the mission, which also involves me gathering assets.
Leonor Zuzarte: So like, if it's an InDesign, I have to locate the InDesign package.
Leonor Zuzarte: If it's a ReadyMag, I have to ask like an art director or someone, because I don't personally use ReadyMag to kind of like duplicate and give access to the person that's going to need it.
Leonor Zuzarte: If it's a Figma, same.
Leonor Zuzarte: One If, have
Sway Clarke: This is for every project.
Sway Clarke: For every treatment, you got to do this because they're all done differently.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, because they're all like each of the treatments is a treatment.
Leonor Zuzarte: So I have to kind of be like, let's say I'm putting six projects for Sway.
Leonor Zuzarte: For each project, I go and I'm like, which platform is it?
Leonor Zuzarte: What assets do I need together?
Leonor Zuzarte: So here's the project.
Leonor Zuzarte: Here are the assets.
Leonor Zuzarte: After that, I then have to review.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I would say reviewing is the part that takes the least.
Leonor Zuzarte: Reviewing is like 10 minutes per treatment just so that I can read it and make sure we really did erase all the information.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: So reviewing, but there's the coordinating of getting the treatment.
Sway Clarke: You got James, they need five.
Sway Clarke: James worked on five different ones.
Sway Clarke: You're like, okay, I got to find out where all the assets are for each of these five things.
Sway Clarke: I've got to put this all together.
Sway Clarke: I've got to give this to a freelancer to do.
Sway Clarke: And then you're going to review it.
Sway Clarke: And so that getting everything together is probably like an hour's worth of time, the reviewing is maybe another 10 minutes after, if there's any changes or whatever.
Sway Clarke: And this happens, you said, every, like you said, about once a quarter, you've got to do like 38 different treatments.
Sway Clarke: No, not so much.
Leonor Zuzarte: I say, I think we really piled up because I was very confused as to how to go about this.
Leonor Zuzarte: So it was like a long process last year where I was like, I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.
Leonor Zuzarte: And Magdalena was like, but we need to get it done.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I was like, OK, but how?
Leonor Zuzarte: And so things kind of piled up, new people kept getting in.
Leonor Zuzarte: And I would ideally like that, like from now on, this would be kind of like a once a quarter thing.
Leonor Zuzarte: Exactly.
Leonor Zuzarte: To avoid the situation that we're in now where we did all of this coordinated by Magdalena.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah.
Leonor Zuzarte: but let's.
Leonor Zuzarte: Last year, kind of like at the beginning of the year, and then we didn't do it again.
Leonor Zuzarte: And so now I would like to do it once a quarter.
Sway Clarke: If you said if you were going to do it once a quarter, if you imagine, OK, we're going to do this once a quarter, you would imagine that you'd have, what, more like 10, between 10 to 12 to do per quarter.
Sway Clarke: Is that another number?
Sway Clarke: OK, so that's interesting.
Sway Clarke: I wanted to ask you, James mentioned something about like projects and the assets, like basically like an email would come in and then he would be on an email and a bunch of people would be on an email and all these assets would be put into the email.
Sway Clarke: And then at some point in time, he's got to like in he has a project in a discord group and then he has to get the assets, like all adjoining assets that he wants to get them into that discord group.
Sway Clarke: He's like, I got to go through this thing and there's all.
Sway Clarke: And so I'm wondering, is this the same place you're looking?
Sway Clarke: For when you're like, I need to find the assets from a treatment, or is that already sorted out already?
Leonor Zuzarte: No, so usually I look at the end result, so I will not be looking at everything that James has to go through, which is usually like, he has to go to the deck and the text and like, let's say a director's note and whatever.
Leonor Zuzarte: I don't look at any of that, I look at like, our final link, and depending what platform the project was delivered on, so if it was an InDesign, more often than not, the freelancers will link their package on to the post-treatment form, I don't know if you've heard about this, it's another beautiful sheet.
Sway Clarke: Another great form.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, it's basically every time that a freelancer finishes a project, they have to kind of reply to this form, they can do.
Leonor Zuzarte: It has to be per project.
Leonor Zuzarte: They can do it after every project, or they can do it once a month, or biweekly, or whatever they feel like doing.
Leonor Zuzarte: But that form asks total hours, total hours on standby, and final product.
Leonor Zuzarte: Okay, so you're looking at a different...
Sway Clarke: Okay, I get that as well.
Sway Clarke: I guess my last question is, because I think we're running over time here, but if you could fix one thing tomorrow, what would make the biggest difference for you?
Sway Clarke: That's a good question.
Sway Clarke: I'm not sure I know.
Leonor Zuzarte: For me, I'm not sure I know.
Leonor Zuzarte: I would say...
Sway Clarke: One of the things we covered, it could be something else that we didn't cover.
Sway Clarke: Hmm.
Sway Clarke: Um-huh.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Do course, go, L60
Leonor Zuzarte: What would make the biggest difference for me?
Leonor Zuzarte: Hmm.
Leonor Zuzarte: I guess I'm going to go with having the team directory and the FCA somehow aligned.
Leonor Zuzarte: If they were both one thing, that would make a good difference for me because it's also something that I do, like...
Leonor Zuzarte: I do it on the first Monday of every month, I try to kind of like revise both so that they are aligned, at least for the beginning of every month.
Sway Clarke: You mean you're aligning these two sheets to make sure they reflect each other?
Leonor Zuzarte: Yes, to make sure that I didn't do any mistakes because I tend to make them.
Sway Clarke: And how long, how much time does that take for you?
Leonor Zuzarte: I'd say like half an hour.
Sway Clarke: Every Monday, you try to do this and it takes you about half an hour of your time to do.
Leonor Zuzarte: Every month?
Sway Clarke: Every first month?
Leonor Zuzarte: Monday I will try to do this and it takes me about half an hour and then throughout the month I will focus on like, oh we raised Sway so let me check that that checks out.
Leonor Zuzarte: Something like that.
Leonor Zuzarte: Aligning.
Sway Clarke: You mean it's basically aligning the sheets.
Sway Clarke: You're spending time aligning these sheets throughout the month.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, sometimes, but not a lot of time.
Leonor Zuzarte: So I would say it's like 10 minutes per week except for that first week of the month where it's like half an hour.
Sway Clarke: 10 minutes a week except for that first day of the week which is half an hour.
Sway Clarke: So like 40 minutes to an hour a week per month.
Sway Clarke: So half an hour every Monday.
Sway Clarke: No, no, no.
Leonor Zuzarte: Half an hour every first Monday.
Sway Clarke: Half an hour every first Monday of the month.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so it's about 40 minutes in a month that you're doing this.
Sway Clarke: And is anybody else like.
Sway Clarke: Is doing the same thing or is anybody else being affected by it?
Leonor Zuzarte: Everyone is affected by it, but ideally I don't have.
Leonor Zuzarte: So that's why we have little mistakes is that ideally I do a reset every month to make sure.
Leonor Zuzarte: Because that's also when the FCA kind of changes.
Leonor Zuzarte: So for every month the FCA is updated.
Leonor Zuzarte: So that means that at the beginning of the month ideally I will look at the rates and make sure that all of the rates for the month that we're about to get into are aligned and correct.
Sway Clarke: So if you could change one thing it would be that, aligning of the sheets?
Sway Clarke: I guess so.
Leonor Zuzarte: think that's really, yeah, I would say so.
Sway Clarke: And because it's annoying, like on a scale of one to ten, what would it be?
Sway Clarke: Like a three or is it more like an eight?
Sway Clarke: схват...
Sway Clarke: you.
Sway Clarke: And it's
Leonor Zuzarte: Scale of 1 to 10?
Leonor Zuzarte: Between a 4 and a 5.
Leonor Zuzarte: Between a 4 and a 5.
Leonor Zuzarte: But that's because I don't really, these are all things that I find to be kind of like around my job but not the point of my job.
Sway Clarke: Okay, so you're doing a lot of these things that are basically not your goal of your job, they're just taking time here and there.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, because like, one of the things that makes this difficult is that I'm also here so that I can kind of like, answer to freelancers needs.
Leonor Zuzarte: So there, in my week, there is a lot of time that is spent, kind of like with someone that's like, hey, and I'm not sure how to invoice for this or hey, I think I made a mistake in my invoice, how do I correct it?
Leonor Zuzarte: Or like, hey, if I were to take three months off, would you guys fire me?
Leonor Zuzarte: You know, I'm the person that all of these things get directed at?
Leonor Zuzarte: Or like, hey, I'm really looking to move up, what can
Leonor Zuzarte: Can I do stuff like that?
Leonor Zuzarte: And that's a bit unpredictable, but that's what I feel is kind of like the point of me existing as a position.
Sway Clarke: So would you say, just to kind of wrap it up, would you say that your goal of your job is community support and freelancer support?
Sway Clarke: And onboarding.
Sway Clarke: But you're spending you're spending time managing the system that does this as opposed to doing that thing.
Leonor Zuzarte: Not as opposed to, but in a way that makes it so that those two things run into each other sometimes.
Sway Clarke: And so it's like instead of my job is this way you're saying is like, I'm here to do this thing.
Sway Clarke: But these things here are taking up time, not allowing me to do this thing, right?
Sway Clarke: Not allowing me to do as much as I would like.
Sway Clarke: I just wanted to wrap it up.
Sway Clarke: Instead of doing community support stuff, I'm actually doing the system stuff.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, I mean, I would say that it's a balance.
Leonor Zuzarte: That's why I have all of those.
Leonor Zuzarte: And these are the things that I do like on the first Monday of the month.
Leonor Zuzarte: And these are the things that I, but yeah, I mean, if the systems were a bit more straightforward or interconnected somehow, then that would shave off some time that would make it so that the response to freelancers themselves could be a little bit more, I don't know.
Sway Clarke: Family?
Sway Clarke: Quality?
Sway Clarke: I'd say quality.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: A little bit more focused.
Leonor Zuzarte: A little bit more focused, a little bit less kind of like, oh, no, and now I have to change all of these things.
Leonor Zuzarte: And so, because we just.
Sway Clarke: I just want to kind of jump off here, but is there any feedback from the freelancers that they're not getting enough support?
Sway Clarke: I don't think so.
Leonor Zuzarte: Not directly to me anyways, since I've taken over my position, because it's also, well, it's no longer, well, it's a toddler.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's no longer a baby, but my position is very much so a toddler.
Leonor Zuzarte: So from a freelancer perspective, it used to be that you would reach out to Madalena and myself and possibly Elise if she was working on bookings.
Leonor Zuzarte: So the booking team between ourselves would do what I am now doing.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, yeah.
Leonor Zuzarte: And it made for a much worse system where freelancers felt like a lot less supportive and a lot less heard.
Leonor Zuzarte: And that they're kind of like their matters were.
Leonor Zuzarte: It's getting solved quick enough.
Leonor Zuzarte: So I would say that from freelancers, the feedback right now is that it's cool that we have this one person that we can reach out to.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Leonor, thank you for your time.
Sway Clarke: don't want to keep you too long.
Sway Clarke: Sway.
Leonor Zuzarte: Would you like me to posteriorly answer your questionnaire?
Leonor Zuzarte: I'm so sorry.
Leonor Zuzarte: I was doing bookings yesterday.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, no worries.
Leonor Zuzarte: Yeah, send it to me now.
Sway Clarke: That would be good.
Sway Clarke: Yeah.
Sway Clarke: Okay.
Sway Clarke: Please, please.
Sway Clarke: And thank you.
Sway Clarke: Of course.
Sway Clarke: So you have a great day.
Sway Clarke: You have a wonderful day.
Leonor Zuzarte: It was lovely to talk to you.
Leonor Zuzarte: Likewise.
Sway Clarke: Likewise.
Sway Clarke: And I'll be talking to you soon.
Sway Clarke: If I have any more questions, I'll just send you an email or something.
Sway Clarke: Feel free.
Sway Clarke: I'll be around.
Sway Clarke: Thank you so much.
Sway Clarke: Bye.
Sway Clarke: Bye.
Sway Clarke: You're welcome.
Sway Clarke: You're welcome.
Sway Clarke: I'm sorry.
Sway Clarke: Thank
