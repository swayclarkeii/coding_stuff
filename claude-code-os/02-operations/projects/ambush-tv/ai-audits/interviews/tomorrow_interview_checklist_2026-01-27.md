  Tomorrow's Cheat Sheet                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                    
  When someone mentions a pain:                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                    
  1. Note it (don't deep-dive yet)                                                                                                                  
  2. After you've heard all pains, ask about the biggest one:                                                                                       
    - "How often?" (Count)                                                                                                                          
    - "How long each time?" (Clock)                                                                                                                 
    - "What happens when it goes wrong?" (Consequence)                                                                                              
    - "Who else deals with this?" (Chain → Compound)                                                                                                
  3. If they say others have it too:                                                                                                                
    - "How many people?"                                                                                                                            
    - "How often for them?"                                                                                                                         
  4. Cross-reference with James:                                                                                                                    
    8- "James mentioned [X]. Do you see that from your side too?"

## Opening Script (Use This)

> "Thanks for taking the time. I have 45 minutes with you today. I'm talking to the team to understand how work actually flows day-to-day. This isn't a performance review - I want to find the boring, repetitive stuff that steals your time so we can fix it. There are no wrong answers."

> "I'm recording for notes. Is that OK? Your input stays confidential - this is about systems, not people."

**Rapport (2 min max):** "How's your week going?"

---

## Must-Ask Questions (Don't Leave Without These)

### For Every Pain Point - The 4 C's
| C | Question |
|---|----------|
| **Count** | "How many times per week does this happen?" |
| **Clock** | "How long does each one take?" |
| **Consequence** | "What happens when it goes wrong?" |
| **Chain** | "Who else is affected when this breaks?" |

### Role Overview
- [ ] "Walk me through a typical week. What do you do Monday morning?"
- [ ] "What triggers that?" / "Then what happens?"
- [ ] "Who do you hand things off to?"

### Pain Points
- [ ] "What task do you dread doing?"
- [ ] "What takes way longer than it should?"
- [ ] "What do you have to do over and over?"
- [ ] "Where do things get stuck or lost?"

### Process Deep-Dive (Pick Biggest Pain)
- [ ] "Let's walk through [PAIN POINT] like I'm shadowing you. What's the very first thing you do?"
- [ ] "What do you click/open first?"
- [ ] "Where does that information come from?"
- [ ] "What tool are you in?"
- [ ] "Where does it go next?"

### Tools Inventory
- [ ] "What apps do you have open right now? What tabs?"
- [ ] "Can you show me your screen?"

### Quantification
- [ ] "How many hours per week do you spend on [TASK]?"
- [ ] "How often does something go wrong?"
- [ ] "How long does it take to fix?"

### CRITICAL - Wrap-Up (Don't Skip!)
- [ ] **"If I could fix ONE thing in your workflow tomorrow, what would make the biggest difference?"**
- [ ] "Is there anything else about your work that we didn't cover?"

---

## Quantification Tactics (When They Say "I Don't Know")

| They Say | You Say |
|----------|---------|
| "I don't know" | "Is it closer to 1 hour or 10 hours per week?" |
| "It varies" | "Give me best case and worst case" |
| "It depends" | "How many times did you do this last week?" |
| "I've never measured" | "If this task disappeared tomorrow, how much time would you get back?" |
| Long pause | "I don't need exact - rough is fine. We're looking for patterns, not precision." |

- [ ] "How many rate updates do you handle per month?"
- [ ] "What happens when a rate is entered incorrectly?"
- [ ] "How do you know which sheet to update when?"
- [ ] "James said he sends you resource requests when projects need more people. What does that look like from your side?"

### If She's Quiet (Use These Prompts)
- "There are no wrong answers - I'm just trying to understand the flow"
- "Even small frustrations are helpful to know about"
- "Can you show me your screen? Sometimes it's easier to walk through visually"

### Deep-Dive (If Time / Clear Pain Emerges)
- [ ] "Let's go deeper on [X]. Walk me step-by-step."
- [ ] Map out: Input → Action → Tool → Output → Handoff
- [ ] Get the 4 C's
- [ ] "What does a busy day look like vs. a slow day?"

## Red Flags to Note

| They Say | Write Down |
|----------|------------|
| "I just know how to do it" | Undocumented process |
| "It depends on..." | Decision logic to capture |
| "We don't have a system for that" | Automation opportunity |
| "I copy from X and paste into Y" | Integration opportunity |
| "I have to chase people for..." | Notification opportunity |
| Long pause + sigh | High frustration = priority |

---

## Time Management Tricks

**If they're going on a tangent:**
> "That's interesting - let me note that. Before we go there, can you first tell me [original question]?"

**If you're running long:**
> "I want to be respectful of your time. Let me ask you the most important question: If I could fix ONE thing tomorrow, what would it be?"

**If they're explaining something you know from James:**
> "Got it - James mentioned that. What I'm curious about from your perspective is [X]."

## Post-Interview Checklist (Do Immediately)

After each call:
- [ ] Note top 3 pain points
- [ ] Note biggest time sink (hours/week estimate)
- [ ] Note any follow-up questions
- [ ] Did I get the 4 C's for main pain? Count: ___ Clock: ___ Consequence: ___ Chain: ___
- [ ] Did I ask the "ONE thing tomorrow" question?
- [ ] Did I get tools inventory?

## Cross-Team Patterns to Watch For

From James interview, look for confirmation of:
- [ ] Document chaos (everyone searching for latest text?)
- [ ] AI tool confusion (who pays for what?)
- [ ] Communication overload (too many messages?)
- [ ] Handoff friction (where do things get stuck?)
- [ ] Mood board dependency (do they wait for James?)

*Remember: 45 minutes. Timer on. Don't skip the wrap-up question.*
