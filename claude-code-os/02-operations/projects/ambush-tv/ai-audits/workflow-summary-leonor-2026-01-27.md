## Key Takeaways

### Most Critical System Issue
**Dual Rate Management (Team Directory + FCA)**
- **Impact:** 70 min/month on alignment + error resolution
- **Frustration Rating:** 4-5/10
- **Leonor's Top Priority:** "If they were both one thing, that would make a good difference for me"
- **Downstream Effects:** Interrupts booking team (Madalena/Elise), creates invoicing errors
- **Solution:** Single source of truth with automatic sync
- **ROI:** 14 hours/year saved + reduced errors + improved team flow

### Biggest Time Drain
**Treatment Sanitization Backlog**
- **Current Backlog:** 38 treatments × 1 hour = 38 hours of Leonor's time
- **Financial Cost:** 38 treatments × €54 = €2,052 in freelancer payments
- **Business Impact:** Booking team can't send portfolios to producers, must "verbally argue" for freelancers
- **Root Cause:** No standardized asset management + retrospective sanitization process
- **Pressure Source:** Madalena (booking team lead)
- **Leonor's Assessment:** "Biggest pain for me because it doesn't tie into any of my other work"

### Core Role Conflict
**System Maintenance vs. Community Support**
- **Leonor's Actual Job:** "Answer to freelancers needs" (support, guidance, relationship management)
- **Current Reality:** 40-45% time on "around my job" tasks (sheet updates, asset hunting, alignment checks)
- **Impact on Quality:** "If systems were more straightforward... response to freelancers could be more quality... more focused"
- **Freelancer Satisfaction:** Currently HIGH (position is improvement over previous split-responsibility model)
- **Risk:** If admin burden increases, support quality will decline

---

## Pain Points Summary

### 1. Dual Rate Management System
**What:** Must manually update freelancer rates in two separate sheets (Team Directory + FCA)
**Frequency:** Bi-weekly rate changes + monthly alignment check + weekly spot checks
**Time Cost:**
- Monthly alignment: 30 minutes
- Weekly checks: 10 minutes × 4 = 40 minutes
- Total: 70 minutes/month = 14 hours/year

**Error Rate:** ~Once every 3 months
**Error Resolution:** 10 minutes + booking team interruption time
**People Affected:** Leonor, Madalena, Elise, Sinbad

**Automation Opportunity:** HIGH
**Priority:** HIGH (Leonor's #1 choice)

---

### 2. Onboarding Master Sheet
**What:** Tracks all freelancer applicants from first contact through onboarding completion
**Sentiment:** "I hate it to the point that I tend to avoid it"
**Why Hated:** "Excruciating detail... a lot of buttons for very little payout"

**Time Cost:**
- Weekly updates (new applicants): 5-10 min × 5 applicants = 25-50 min/month
- Deep dive (every 1-2 months): 2-4 hours
- Post-interview entry: 5-10 min per interview
- Annual Total: ~12-24 hours/year (amplified by procrastination)

**Behavior Pattern:** Task avoidance → anxiety → binge updating → "spend the whole day updating it"
**Value:** Detail IS necessary (applications can sit 1-2 months before action)

**Automation Opportunity:** MEDIUM
**Priority:** MEDIUM (quality of life improvement)

---

### 3. Treatment Sanitization Coordination
**What:** Coordinating anonymization of client projects for freelancer portfolios
**Business Need:** Producers request portfolios when considering freelancers for projects

**Process Complexity:**
1. Identify portfolio needs (e.g., 8 freelancers need portfolios)
2. Gather past projects to Portfolio Sheet
3. Get art director approval on which to sanitize
4. Hunt for assets across platforms (InDesign, ReadyMag, Figma)
5. Assign 6 treatments per freelancer (2-3 freelancers per batch)
6. Freelancer sanitizes (3 hours each)
7. Receive new link, add to Project Directory + Portfolio Sheet
8. Review sanitized version (10 min each)

**Time Cost Per Treatment:**
- Leonor's coordination: 1-1.5 hours
- Freelancer execution: 3 hours at €18/hour = €54
- Total: 4-4.5 hours combined

**Current Backlog:**
- 38 treatments remaining
- 38 hours of Leonor's time
- €2,052 in freelancer costs
- Pressure from Madalena to complete

**Ideal Frequency:** Quarterly (10-12 treatments)
**Historical Issue:** Confusion about process → backlog pileup in 2024
**Impact When Delayed:** Booking team loses credibility with producers, harder to place freelancers

**Automation Opportunity:** CRITICAL
**Priority:** CRITICAL (current crisis + ongoing efficiency)

## Cross-Role Patterns (Leonor + James)

### Shared Pain Point: Asset Management Chaos
**James:** Struggles to find assets across email threads for creative work
**Leonor:** Struggles to find InDesign packages, ReadyMag, Figma files for sanitization
**Root Cause:** No centralized asset management system
**Shared Solution:** Recommendation #3 (Asset Management System) benefits both roles

### Shared Pain Point: Multi-Sheet Syndrome
**James:** Multiple disconnected project tracking sheets
**Leonor:** 6+ sheets (Team Directory, FCA, Onboarding Master, Portfolio Sheet, Post-Treatment Form, Newbie Tracker)
**Root Cause:** Systems built independently without integration
**Pattern:** Manual sync requirements + error potential + cognitive overhead

### Shared Pain Point: Admin Time Stealing Core Work
**James:** Creative time interrupted by system maintenance
**Leonor:** Community support time interrupted by sheet alignment, asset hunting, etc.
**Current Split (Both):** ~40-45% admin, ~55-60% core work
**Goal (Both):** Reduce admin to 20-30% through automation

### Leonor-Specific Context
**ADHD + Multiple Interrupt Streams:** Feedback requests, support questions, calls
**Challenge:** Context switching amplifies cognitive load
**Need:** Systems that reduce interruptions and batch-friendly workflows

## Key Quotes for Audit Report

**On her core purpose:**
> "I'm also here so that I can kind of like, answer to freelancers needs... that's what I feel is kind of like the point of me existing as a position."

**On system vs. role conflict:**
> "These are all things that I find to be kind of like around my job but not the point of my job."

**On automation impact:**
> "If the systems were a bit more straightforward or interconnected somehow, then that would shave off some time that would make it so that the response to freelancers themselves could be a little bit more... quality... A little bit more focused."

**On the Onboarding Master Sheet:**
> "I hate it to the point that I tend to avoid it and then have to spend the whole day updating it... it's a lot of buttons for, like, very little payout."

**On treatment sanitization:**
> "This is the biggest pain for me because it doesn't tie into any of my other work."

**On top priority fix:**
> "I guess I'm going to go with having the team directory and the FCA somehow aligned. If they were both one thing, that would make a good difference for me."

**On the real impact:**
> "A little bit more focused, a little bit less kind of like, oh, no, and now I have to change all of these things."

## Conclusion

Leonor's interview reveals a critical pattern: **a dedicated HR/Community role being undermined by disconnected administrative systems**.

While freelancers are satisfied with having "one person to reach out to," Leonor is spending 40-45% of her time on system maintenance rather than relationship building and support. The three major pain points (dual rate system, onboarding sheet tedium, treatment sanitization backlog) are all **solvable through automation and integration**.

**Most importantly:** These aren't just Leonor's problems. The dual rate system affects the booking team. Treatment sanitization delays affect booking credibility with producers. Asset management chaos affects both Leonor AND the creative team (James).

**Recommendation:** Prioritize the "interconnected" solutions Leonor mentioned. Quick wins (rate system merge) build momentum. Foundation projects (asset management) solve cross-team problems. Together, these can reduce Leonor's admin burden by 35-40%, freeing 60-80 hours/year for higher-value community support work.

**The business case is clear:** Better systems → more focused support → happier freelancers → better retention and productivity.
