## Performance Summary

| Interview | Date | Role Type | Framework Score | Quantification | Overall |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| James RG Neville | 2026-01-26 | Creative (Staff) | 6/10 | Weak | Baseline |
| Leonor Zuzarte | 2026-01-27 | HR/Community (Staff) | 8/10 | Strong | Improved |

## Interview #1: James RG Neville

**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Role:** Art Director (Creative Team)
**Duration:** ~60 min (two sessions)
**Type:** Staff-level

### Framework Adherence: 6/10

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Set context upfront | Good | Explained audit purpose |
| Walk-through structure | Weak | 6+ min personal chat before business |
| Quantification prompts | Weak | ~5 explicit time questions |
| Pain point drilling | Good | Explored multiple areas |
| Staff-appropriate tone | Good | Relatable, peer-level |

### Quantification Tactics

- Often got narrative responses without hard numbers
- "What does your day look like?" → long descriptions
- Time estimates came late or vague ("a third of my day")
- Did not consistently push for specific hours/frequency

### What Worked

- Got James to share screen (visual context)
- Explored AI workflow in detail
- Captured pain around asset management
- Built rapport quickly

### Areas for Improvement

- Get to business faster
- Push for specific numbers earlier
- Ask pain scale ratings
- Trace cross-role impacts more explicitly

## Interview #2: Leonor Zuzarte

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Role:** HR & Community Manager
**Duration:** ~35 min
**Type:** Staff-level

### Framework Adherence: 8/10

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Set context upfront | Better | Faster transition to business |
| Walk-through structure | Strong | "Walk me through typical week" |
| Quantification prompts | Strong | 15+ explicit time questions |
| Pain point drilling | Strong | Multiple pain points with depth |
| Staff-appropriate tone | Good | Same relatable approach |

### Quantification Tactics - Major Improvement

Consistently pushed for specifics:

| Your Question | Result |
|---------------|--------|
| "How long does it take?" | "A couple of hours to half my day" |
| "How often a week?" | "Every Monday" |
| "Per person, how long?" | "5 minutes, not even" |
| "How many freelancers a month?" | "About 5" |
| "What's the frequency?" | "Once every 3 months" |
| "On a scale of 1-10?" | "Between 4 and 5" |

**Key technique:** Did math out loud to confirm understanding:
> "10 minutes a week except for that first day which is half an hour. So like 40 minutes to an hour per month."

### Staff Interview Tactics

What you did right for staff-level:

1. **No jargon** - Avoided business consultant speak
2. **Acknowledged expertise** - "You're the one that knows this system"
3. **Normalized frustration** - Made it safe to discuss the sheet she "hates"
4. **Probed system vs. personal** - Redirected to frequency/impact
5. **Role clarity** - Identified core role vs. time drain

**Key moment:** When Leonor said "these are things around my job but not the point of my job" - you synthesized:
> "So you're spending time managing the system as opposed to doing that thing."

### What Worked

- Fast to business (~2 min vs ~6 min)
- Consistent quantification throughout
- Pain scale ratings (twice)
- Traced impacts to Madalena/Alice
- Strong wrap-up question: "If you could fix one thing tomorrow?"

### Areas Still to Improve

1. **Screen share** - Didn't request to see her sheets (Newbie Tracker, Team Directory, FCA, Onboarding Master)
2. **Ripple effect questions** - Could push harder: "If this breaks, who calls you? What happens to their day?"
3. **Solution anchoring** - Note the PROBLEM, not adopt their proposed solution
4. **Time boxing** - Mentioned 45 min but didn't enforce it

| Pain scale ratings | 0 | 2 | Added |
| System impact tracing | Some | Strong | Improved |
| Wrap-up question | Vague | Actionable | Improved |

## Technique Reference

### Quantification Prompts to Use

- "How long does that take you?"
- "How often does this happen? Weekly? Monthly?"
- "Per [unit], what's the time investment?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is this?"
- "If you add it up, what's the monthly total?"
- "What happens if this goes wrong? How long to fix?"

### Staff Interview Best Practices

- Get to business within 2-3 minutes
- Use "walk me through" structure
- Push for numbers on every pain point
- Ask who else is affected
- Confirm understanding by repeating back with math
- End with "if you could fix one thing tomorrow"
- Request screen share when discussing systems

### Things to Avoid

- Long personal chat upfront (save for end if needed)
- Accepting vague answers ("takes a while" → "how long specifically?")
- Adopting their solution language (note the problem, not their fix)
- Forgetting to ask pain scale ratings
