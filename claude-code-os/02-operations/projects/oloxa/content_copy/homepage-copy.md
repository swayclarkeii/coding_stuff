## HERO SECTION

### Headline (Bold, ALL CAPS)
**YOUR BUSINESS IS BROKEN**
**YOU JUST CAN'T PINPOINT WHERE**

### Subheadline (Short, direct)
Most automation agencies hear your request and start building. I ask diagnostic questions that uncover what's actually broken — then redesign your operations before automating anything.

### CTA Button
**BOOK A DISCOVERY SESSION** - £FREE

### Supporting Text
60 minutes. No sales pitch. Just diagnostic questions that reveal root causes.

## MOST AUTOMATION BUILDS THE WRONG THING

### Body Copy (Concise)
You say: "Automate our proposals."

**What you actually mean:** Our sales team wastes hours gathering requirements because we don't have a clear discovery system.

Most agencies build proposal automation. I redesign your discovery process — then use AI to enable it.

**The difference?** Strategic transformation, not technical automation.

---

## WHAT I ACTUALLY DO

### Value Proposition (Short)
I diagnose root causes in your business operations using skills from my background as a parent coach and serial entrepreneur — then redesign processes strategically before building anything.

**The result:** £50K-£100K+ annual impact from transformation, not just faster busywork.

---

## DIAGNOSIS FIRST, ALWAYS

### Philosophy Statement (Like "Human First, Always")
I learned as a parent coach that the problem people describe is rarely the actual problem.

**The same is true for businesses.**

Through diagnostic discovery, I uncover what's actually broken vs. what feels broken. Then we redesign operations to work better — using AI as the enabling tool, not the product.

**My commitment:** If I don't see 5-10x ROI opportunities during discovery, I'll refund your investment. I only work with clients where I know I can create substantial value.

---

## MY BACKGROUND

### Personal Story (Concise with Photo)
[PHOTO: Sway - warm, authentic, approachable]

**I'm Sway, founder of Oloxa.** I'm a former parent coach with 23 years as a serial entrepreneur. I understand the real pressure of operational chaos, leading teams, and knowing things could be better but not knowing where to start.

I built Oloxa because I saw businesses hiring automation agencies who took orders and built what was asked for — but never diagnosed the actual problem.

**I wanted to change that.**

---

## PERFECT FOR

### Target Audience Boxes

**PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FIRMS**
Consulting, accounting, legal, agencies with complex operations

**B2B COMPANIES**
Complex sales processes, multiple stakeholders, revenue bottlenecks

**REGIONAL SERVICE BUSINESSES**
Multiple locations, operational complexity, scaling challenges

**ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES**
£1M-£25M revenue, enough complexity to benefit from strategic transformation

---

## HOW IT WORKS

### Simple Timeline

**DAYS 1-3: Diagnostic Discovery**
We talk about your business operations. I ask questions that uncover root causes, not symptoms.

**DAYS 4-7: Strategic Analysis**
I analyze what's actually broken vs. what feels broken. Identify 5-10x ROI opportunities.

**DAYS 8-14: Transformation Design**
We redesign processes strategically before building anything. Map business outcomes to AI capabilities.

**DAY 15 ONWARDS: Implementation**
Build the technical solutions that enable your improved processes. Train your team. Optimize continuously.

## REAL TRANSFORMATIONS

### Case Study 1: Professional Services Firm
**They asked for:** Proposal automation
**I discovered:** Requirements gathering was the problem, not proposal creation
**We redesigned:** Their discovery process with structured intake
**The impact:** 70% time reduction + 30% close rate increase = **£50K+ annually**

### Case Study 2: Manufacturing Company
**They asked for:** Inventory tracking automation
**I discovered:** No clear reorder protocols or purchasing authority
**We redesigned:** Operational processes with defined reorder points
**The impact:** From monthly inventory issues to quarterly = **£100K+ annually**

### Case Study 3: Accounting Firm
**They asked for:** Automated client updates
**I discovered:** Update quality was the issue, not frequency
**We redesigned:** Communication framework with clear templates
**The impact:** Client satisfaction scores improved dramatically + better retention

## TRANSFORMATION NOT AUTOMATION

### The Difference (Comparison Table)

| **Automation Builders** | **Transformation Partners** |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Ask: "What can we automate?" | Ask: "What problems prevent your goals?" |
| Focus: Making processes faster | Focus: Redesigning processes to work better |
| Deliver: Technical implementations | Deliver: Strategic transformation |
| Result: Faster chaos | Result: £50K-£100K+ annual impact |

**I focus on Tier 3-4 work:**
- Revenue enhancement (£25K-£75K impact)
- Competitive differentiation (£75K-£100K+ impact)

Not simple efficiency gains that save a few hours.

---

## STARTING AT £5K

### Investment Levels

**Discovery & Diagnostic:** £5K-£10K
Root cause analysis, opportunity identification, strategic roadmap

**Revenue Enhancement (Tier 3):** £25K-£75K
Unlock growth opportunities, improve revenue generation capabilities

**Competitive Differentiation (Tier 4):** £75K-£150K
Create sustainable advantages competitors can't replicate

**My guarantee:** If discovery doesn't uncover 5-10x ROI opportunities, full refund.

## WHO THIS IS FOR

### Clear Qualification

**You're a fit if you:**
- Know something is broken but can't pinpoint what
- Are tired of tactical fixes that don't solve root problems
- Want strategic transformation, not just efficiency gains
- Understand diagnosis is more valuable than quickly building wrong solutions
- View this as partnership, not vendor transaction

**Not a fit if you:**
- Want quick tactical automations
- Need the cheapest "automation builder"
- Aren't ready to invest in discovery before implementation

## COMMON QUESTIONS

### FAQ (Concise)

**How is this different from automation agencies?**
Most agencies ask "what can we automate?" and start building. I ask "what's actually broken?" and start diagnosing.

**I'm not a tech person. Will this work?**
This approach is better for non-technical owners. We start with business problems you understand, not technical solutions you shouldn't have to.

**What if I know what I want automated?**
Perfect — let's start there. But I'll also ask diagnostic questions to ensure we're solving the right problem.

**How long does transformation take?**
Discovery: 2-4 weeks. Design: 2-4 weeks. Implementation: 4-12 weeks. But you'll see measurable outcomes within 30-60 days.

## WHY WORK WITH ME

### Personal Credibility (With Photo)
[PHOTO: Sway working with client, whiteboard diagnostic session]

**Parent coach diagnostic skills** meet **serial entrepreneur operations knowledge.**

I learned as a coach that the problem described is rarely the actual problem. I ask questions that uncover root causes.

As an entrepreneur, I've experienced operational chaos firsthand. I know the frustration of seeing problems but not knowing where to start.

**The combination:** I diagnose what's actually broken before building anything. Strategic transformation, not technical automation.
