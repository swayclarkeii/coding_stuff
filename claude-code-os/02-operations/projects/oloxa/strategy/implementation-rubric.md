## 📋 RUBRIC OVERVIEW

### How to Use This Document

This rubric maps your new transformation copy to your existing Oloxa.ai website structure. For each section:

- ✅ **KEEP** = Works well, minor edits only
- ⚠️ **UPDATE** = Structure works, but copy needs transformation
- ❌ **REPLACE** = Doesn't align with transformation positioning

**Key Metrics:**
- **Current average section length:** 150-200 words
- **Target section length (House of Sonder AI style):** 50-75 words
- **Target text reduction:** 60-70%

---

## SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

---

## 1. HERO SECTION (Above the Fold)

### Current State: ⚠️ UPDATE

**What's Currently There:**
```
Headline: "Work Less. Earn More With AI."
Subheadline: "Helping small businesses and solopreneurs save hours, boost revenue, and never miss a customer — all with AI."
CTA: "Work With Us →"
Supporting text: "You don't need a tech department to work smarter. Our AI systems handle the busywork so you can focus on what matters most."
```

**Word Count:** ~45 words (hero text only)

### ✅ What Works:
- Outcome-focused headline (clear benefit)
- Simple CTA button
- Addresses "no tech needed" objection
- Clean layout structure

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Generic positioning ("small businesses and solopreneurs")
- No differentiation from automation agencies
- Feature-focused language ("AI systems")
- Missing personal/human connection
- No diagnostic/transformation angle

### New Transformation Copy:

**Option 1: Bold & Provocative (House of Sonder AI Style)**
```
Headline: YOUR BUSINESS IS BROKEN
         YOU JUST CAN'T PINPOINT WHERE

Subheadline: Most automation agencies hear your request and start building. I ask diagnostic questions that uncover what's actually broken — then redesign your operations before automating anything.

CTA: BOOK A DISCOVERY SESSION (Free)

Supporting text: 60 minutes. No sales pitch. Just diagnostic questions that reveal root causes.
```

**Option 2: Empathetic & Problem-Focused**
```
Headline: You Know Your Business Could Run Better.
         You Just Can't Pinpoint What's Actually Broken.

Subheadline: I help you diagnose root causes in your operations using skills from my background as a parent coach and serial entrepreneur — then redesign processes strategically before building anything.

CTA: Start With a Discovery Session →

Supporting text: No sales pitch. No technical jargon. Just a conversation about what's actually preventing your business from achieving its goals.
```

### Recommended Choice: **Option 1**
- More aligned with House of Sonder AI's bold style
- Provocative headline creates pattern interrupt
- Emphasizes diagnostic approach immediately
- **Word count:** 52 words (comparable to current, more impactful)

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: 45 words
- New: 52 words
- Change: +7 words (but higher impact)

### Implementation Notes:
- Keep existing hero layout/structure
- Replace headline text only
- Update CTA button text to "BOOK A DISCOVERY SESSION"
- Add supporting "60 minutes" line under CTA
- Consider bold ALL CAPS for headline (like House of Sonder AI)

---

## 2. VALUE PROPOSITION SECTION

### Current State: ❌ REPLACE

**What's Currently There:**
```
Implied section: "Helping small businesses save hours, boost revenue, and never miss a customer"
(This is embedded in hero, not a separate section)
```

**Word Count:** ~15 words (embedded in hero)

### ✅ What Works:
- Outcome focus (hours, revenue, customers)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- No clear differentiation
- Focused on efficiency (Tier 1-2)
- Missing transformation positioning
- No diagnostic angle
- Generic automation language

### New Transformation Copy:

**Add New Section: "MOST AUTOMATION BUILDS THE WRONG THING"**

```
Body Copy:
You say: "Automate our proposals."

What you actually mean: Our sales team wastes hours gathering requirements because we don't have a clear discovery system.

Most agencies build proposal automation. I redesign your discovery process — then use AI to enable it.

The difference? Strategic transformation, not technical automation.
```

**Word Count:** 52 words

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: Not a dedicated section (embedded in hero ~15 words)
- New: 52 words as standalone section
- Change: +37 words (new section entirely)

### Implementation Notes:
- Add this as new section immediately after hero
- Use comparison structure (common request → what you actually mean)
- Emphasize diagnostic discovery
- Keep ultra-concise (House of Sonder AI style)
- Visual suggestion: Two-column layout (left: what they ask / right: what they mean)

---

## 3. PROCESS / "HOW WE WORK" SECTION

### Current State: ✅ KEEP STRUCTURE (update copy and remove timeline)

**What's Currently There:**
```
Section: "How We Work" (4-step process)
1. Discovery Call
2. Custom Plan
3. Building & Testing
4. Launch & Support

Estimated word count: 120-150 words
```

### ✅ What Works:
- Clear visual structure (easy to follow)
- Logical flow
- Good visual hierarchy
- Process transparency

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Specific timeline (Days 1-3, etc.) doesn't match your custom process
- Generic agency language
- No emphasis on diagnostic discovery
- Missing training component at end

---

### **HEADLINE OPTIONS (Choose One):**

**Option A: Simple & Clear**
```
HOW WE WORK
```

**Option B: Process-Focused (Recommended)**
```
HOW WE WORK
From Discovery to Implementation
```

**Option C: Transformation-Focused**
```
HOW WE WORK
The True Integration Process
```

**Recommended:** **Option B** (clear, descriptive, not overblown)

---

### New Transformation Copy - STEP-BASED (Not Timeline):

---

### **VERSION 1: YOUR ACTUAL PROCESS**

```
STEP 1: Free Discovery Call
We discuss your business operations and challenges. No sales pitch — just understanding where AI could actually help you.

STEP 2: Diagnostic Sessions
A series of calls where I ask questions to uncover what's actually broken vs. what feels broken. I identify 5-10x ROI opportunities.

STEP 3: Solution Presentation
I work with my developers to design a solution tailored to your business. We present the approach and ensure it aligns with your goals.

STEP 4: Agreement & Development
Once you approve the solution, we enter the development phase. You'll have visibility into progress throughout.

STEP 5: Implementation & Training
We execute the solution and train your team hands-on. This isn't "here's the software" — it's full integration into your culture and systems.

STEP 6: Ongoing Support
We optimize continuously and stay with you as your business evolves. AI integration is ongoing, not one-and-done.
```

**Word Count:** 159 words

**Why this works:**
- Matches your actual process exactly
- No artificial timeline (custom deals)
- Emphasizes free discovery call
- Mentions developers (transparency)
- Includes training as dedicated step
- Shows ongoing support

---

### **VERSION 2: CONDENSED (Recommended)**

```
STEP 1: Free Discovery Call
We discuss your operations. No sales pitch, just understanding your challenges.

STEP 2: Diagnostic Sessions
Multiple calls to uncover what's actually broken and identify 5-10x ROI opportunities.

STEP 3: Solution Design
I work with my developers to create a tailored solution and present it for your approval.

STEP 4: Development & Implementation
We build the solution and integrate it into your existing culture, systems, and ethics.

STEP 5: Training & Support
Hands-on team training and ongoing optimization as your business evolves.
```

**Word Count:** 92 words

**Why this works:**
- More concise (House of Sonder AI style)
- Still captures your actual process
- Combines Development + Implementation (one step)
- Combines Training + Support (one step)
- Easier to scan visually

---

### **VERSION 3: ULTRA-CONCISE (Maximum House of Sonder AI Style)**

```
STEP 1: Free Discovery
No sales pitch. Just understanding your operations and challenges.

STEP 2: Diagnose
Series of calls to identify what's actually broken and where AI creates 5-10x ROI.

STEP 3: Design Solution
Work with developers to create tailored approach. Present for your approval.

STEP 4: Build & Integrate
Develop solution and integrate into your culture, systems, and ethics.

STEP 5: Train & Optimize
Hands-on team training. Ongoing support as you grow.
```

**Word Count:** 75 words

**Why this works:**
- Shortest version (50% reduction from Version 1)
- Punchiest language
- Still captures all key steps
- Best matches House of Sonder AI concise style

---

### Recommended Choice: **VERSION 2 (Condensed)**

**Rationale:**
- Balances completeness with conciseness
- Captures your actual process clearly
- Easier to scan than Version 1
- More substantial than Version 3
- ~90 words is sweet spot for this section

**Alternative:** Use Version 3 if you want maximum House of Sonder AI style matching

---

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: ~120-150 words with timeline
- New Version 1: 159 words (no timeline, more steps)
- New Version 2: 92 words (condensed)
- New Version 3: 75 words (ultra-concise)
- Recommended: Version 2 at 92 words (23-38% reduction)

---

### Implementation Notes:
- **REMOVE:** All specific timeline references (Days 1-3, Days 4-7, etc.)
- **KEEP:** Step-based structure (works with your custom deals)
- **ADD:** "Free Discovery Call" emphasis (important differentiator)
- **ADD:** "Training" as dedicated step (per your feedback)
- **KEEP:** "5-10x ROI opportunities" language (powerful specificity)
- **EMPHASIZE:** "Series of calls" for diagnosis (matches your process)
- **MENTION:** "Developers" for transparency (you work with team)
- **ADD:** "Culture, systems, and ethics" integration language
- Visual suggestion: Keep existing 4-6 step layout structure

---

## 4. WHAT WE OFFER / SERVICES SECTION

### Current State: ❌ REPLACE ENTIRELY

**What's Currently There:**
```
Feature-focused language: "AI voice and chat agents", "Automate busywork", "24/7 customer service"
Target audience: Generic "small businesses"

Estimated word count: 80-100 words
```

### ✅ What Works:
- Addresses pain points (in concept)
- Clear structure

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Feature-focused (not problem-focused)
- Wrong target audience (too broad)
- Missing training and education component
- No mention of culture, systems, ethics integration
- No pain point → solution structure

---

### New Transformation Copy - RESTRUCTURED:

---

### **HEADLINE OPTIONS (Choose One):**

**Option A: Problem-Focused**
```
WHAT WE OFFER
Pain Points We Solve for Small-to-Medium Businesses
```

**Option B: Transformation-Focused (Recommended)**
```
WHAT WE OFFER
True AI Integration for Growing Teams
```

**Option C: Direct & Clear**
```
WHAT WE OFFER
AI Integration + Training for 5-50 Employee Businesses
```

**Recommended:** **Option B** (transformation positioning, not just tools)

---

### **SECTION STRUCTURE:**

**Target Audience Box (Add at top):**
```
FOR SMALL-TO-MEDIUM BUSINESSES
5-50 employees ready to integrate AI into their operations without fear or confusion
```

---

### **PAIN POINTS & SOLUTIONS FORMAT (Recommended):**

```
AI INTEGRATION THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

You're overwhelmed by AI options and don't know where to start.
→ We diagnose your specific operations and recommend what will actually help you.

You're scared of adopting AI the wrong way and disrupting your team.
→ We integrate AI into your existing culture, systems, and ethics — not force-fit generic tools.

You need your team trained, not just handed software.
→ We provide hands-on training and education so your team adopts AI confidently and effectively.

You want operational improvement, not just shiny tech.
→ We focus on solving real business problems: communication gaps, process bottlenecks, revenue leaks.
```

**Word Count:** 107 words

---

### **ALTERNATIVE: SERVICES + INTEGRATION FORMAT**

If you prefer a more traditional services structure with integration emphasis:

```
AI INTEGRATION FOR GROWING TEAMS

OPERATIONAL DIAGNOSIS
We identify where AI can solve real problems in your business — not just automate for automation's sake.

STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION
We integrate AI into your existing culture, systems, and ethical frameworks. No disruption, just improvement.

TEAM TRAINING & EDUCATION
We train your team (5-50 employees) to use AI confidently. Hands-on education, not just documentation.

ONGOING SUPPORT
We stay with you as you grow, optimizing and adjusting AI solutions as your business evolves.
```

**Word Count:** 80 words

---

### **RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Pain Points & Solutions Format**

**Why:**
- Directly addresses your feedback (pain points and solutions)
- Emphasizes training and education
- Highlights culture, systems, ethics integration
- Targets 5-50 employee SMBs specifically
- More empathetic and less feature-focused

---

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: ~80-100 words (feature descriptions)
- New: 107 words (pain points & solutions) OR 80 words (services format)
- Change: Similar length, completely different positioning

---

### Implementation Notes:
- **CRITICAL:** Change target audience from "£1M-£25M revenue" to "5-50 employee businesses"
- Add "training and education" as core component (not just mentioned in passing)
- Emphasize "integration into culture, systems, and ethics"
- Use pain point → solution arrows (→) for visual clarity
- Structure as 4 pain points with 4 solutions
- Alternative: Use 4 services boxes if you prefer traditional structure

---

## 5. YOUR STORY / "MY BACKGROUND" SECTION

### Current State: ❌ MISSING (CRITICAL GAP)

**What's Currently There:**
```
No personal story section on homepage
No mention of parent coach background
No mention of entrepreneurial journey
No human connection element
```

**Word Count:** 0 words (doesn't exist)

### ✅ What Works:
- N/A (section doesn't exist)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Missing entirely (biggest gap vs. House of Sonder AI)
- No trust-building narrative
- No differentiation through personal story
- Generic agency positioning without human element

---

### New Transformation Copy - THREE VERSIONS:

---

### **OPTION 1: Problem-Focused**

```
[PHOTO: Sway - warm, authentic, approachable]

I'm Sway, founder of Oloxa. I'm a former parent coach with ten years as a serial entrepreneur. I understand the real pressure of operational chaos and managing teams.

I observed businesses struggling to make the leap in implementing or improving their operational systems using AI. Many were overwhelmed, confused, or scared of the technology.

I built Oloxa because many agencies were not truly helping businesses integrate these services — they were just providing tools.

I wanted to change that.
```

**Word Count:** 90 words

**Why this works:**
- Emphasizes the problem businesses face (overwhelmed, confused, scared)
- Clear differentiation: integration vs. tools
- Personal commitment statement at end
- Direct and empathetic tone

---

### **OPTION 2: Concise & Bold (House of Sonder AI Style) - RECOMMENDED**

```
[PHOTO: Sway - warm, authentic, approachable]

I'm Sway. Former parent coach. Ten years as a serial entrepreneur managing teams through operational chaos.

I watched small businesses struggle with AI — overwhelmed, confused, scared. Agencies sold them tools, not integration.

That's not help. That's abandonment.

I built Oloxa to truly integrate AI into your culture, systems, and ethics — not just hand you software and disappear.
```

**Word Count:** 67 words

**Why this works:**
- Punchy, bold language (matches House of Sonder AI)
- Strong statement: "That's not help. That's abandonment."
- Emphasizes integration into culture, systems, ethics
- More provocative tone
- Most memorable

---

### **OPTION 3: Story-Driven (Extended)**

```
[PHOTO: Sway - warm, authentic, approachable]

I'm Sway, founder of Oloxa. As a parent coach, I learned that transformation requires understanding, not just tools.

For ten years as a serial entrepreneur, I managed teams through operational chaos. I know the pressure you're under.

Then I watched businesses approach AI with fear and confusion. They hired agencies who sold them tools — but never helped them truly integrate AI into their culture, their systems, their ethics.

That's when I realized: businesses don't need more tools. They need a partner who helps them adopt AI the right way.

I built Oloxa to be that partner.
```

**Word Count:** 106 words

**Why this works:**
- Connects parent coaching to business (transformation requires understanding)
- More narrative-driven (builds emotional connection)
- Emphasizes partnership approach
- Longer but more complete story arc

---

### Recommended Choice: **OPTION 2 (Concise & Bold)**

**Rationale:**
- Best matches House of Sonder AI's punchy style
- Strong differentiation statement ("That's abandonment")
- Introduces "culture, systems, ethics" integration focus
- Memorable and provocative

**Alternative:** Use Option 1 if you want less provocative tone while keeping key messages

---

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: 0 words (doesn't exist)
- Option 1: 90 words
- Option 2: 67 words (recommended)
- Option 3: 106 words
- Change: +67-106 words (new section entirely)

---

### Implementation Notes:
- **CRITICAL ADDITION** - this is the #1 gap vs. House of Sonder AI
- Place after "What We Offer" section or after "How We Work"
- Include personal photo (warm, not corporate headshot)
- Keep concise (60-90 words recommended)
- Emphasizes: parent coach + 10 years entrepreneur + integration focus
- Visual suggestion: Photo left, text right (or photo above text on mobile)

---

## 6. CASE STUDIES / RESULTS SECTION

### Current State: ❌ MISSING (MAJOR GAP)

**What's Currently There:**
```
No case studies on homepage
No social proof examples
No transformation stories
No quantified business outcomes
```

**Word Count:** 0 words (doesn't exist)

### ✅ What Works:
- N/A (section doesn't exist)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Missing entirely (second biggest gap vs. House of Sonder AI)
- No credibility through real examples
- No Tier 3-4 outcome demonstration
- No transformation vs. automation differentiation

### New Transformation Copy:

**Add New Section: "REAL TRANSFORMATIONS"**

```
Case Study 1: Professional Services Firm
They asked for: Proposal automation
I discovered: Requirements gathering was the problem, not proposal creation
We redesigned: Their discovery process with structured intake
The impact: 70% time reduction + 30% close rate increase = £50K+ annually

Case Study 2: Manufacturing Company
They asked for: Inventory tracking automation
I discovered: No clear reorder protocols or purchasing authority
We redesigned: Operational processes with defined reorder points
The impact: From monthly inventory issues to quarterly = £100K+ annually

Case Study 3: Accounting Firm
They asked for: Automated client updates
I discovered: Update quality was the issue, not frequency
We redesigned: Communication framework with clear templates
The impact: Client satisfaction scores improved dramatically + better retention
```

**Word Count:** 138 words (46 words per case study)

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: 0 words (doesn't exist)
- New: 138 words total (3 cases)
- Change: +138 words (new section entirely)

### Implementation Notes:
- **CRITICAL ADDITION** - demonstrates transformation vs. automation
- Place after "My Background" section
- Use consistent structure: Asked for → Discovered → Redesigned → Impact
- Emphasize £50K-£100K+ outcomes (Tier 3-4 positioning)
- Visual suggestion: 3 cards/boxes with consistent formatting
- Keep each case study to ~40-50 words maximum

---

## 7. PHILOSOPHY SECTION (NEW)

### Current State: ❌ MISSING (DIFFERENTIATION GAP)

**What's Currently There:**
```
No philosophy/values statement
No positioning statement
No "why this matters" section
```

**Word Count:** 0 words (doesn't exist)

### ✅ What Works:
- N/A (section doesn't exist)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Missing House of Sonder AI-style philosophy section
- No "Human First, Always" equivalent
- No clear values-driven positioning

### New Transformation Copy:

**Add New Section: "DIAGNOSIS FIRST, ALWAYS"**

```
I learned as a parent coach that the problem people describe is rarely the actual problem.

The same is true for businesses.

Through diagnostic discovery, I uncover what's actually broken vs. what feels broken. Then we redesign operations to work better — using AI as the enabling tool, not the product.

My commitment: If I don't see 5-10x ROI opportunities during discovery, I'll refund your investment. I only work with clients where I know I can create substantial value.
```

**Word Count:** 79 words

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: 0 words (doesn't exist)
- New: 79 words
- Change: +79 words (new section entirely)

### Implementation Notes:
- **INSPIRED BY:** House of Sonder AI's "HUMAN FIRST, ALWAYS" section
- Place after case studies or before FAQ
- Bold headline "DIAGNOSIS FIRST, ALWAYS"
- Emphasizes coaching background → business application
- Includes guarantee (builds trust)
- Visual suggestion: Centered text, bold headline, simple layout

---

### Current State: ❌ MISSING (TRANSPARENCY GAP)

**What's Currently There:**
```
No pricing information
No investment levels shown
No transparency about engagement costs
```

**Word Count:** 0 words (doesn't exist)

### ✅ What Works:
- N/A (section doesn't exist)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Missing pricing transparency (House of Sonder AI shows "Starting At £749")
- No qualification through investment levels
- Creates friction (prospects don't know if they can afford you)

### New Transformation Copy:

**Add New Section: "STARTING AT £5K"**

```
Discovery & Diagnostic: £5K-£10K
Root cause analysis, opportunity identification, strategic roadmap

Revenue Enhancement (Tier 3): £25K-£75K
Unlock growth opportunities, improve revenue generation capabilities

Competitive Differentiation (Tier 4): £75K-£150K
Create sustainable advantages competitors can't replicate

My guarantee: If discovery doesn't uncover 5-10x ROI opportunities, full refund.
```

**Word Count:** 52 words

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: 0 words (doesn't exist)
- New: 52 words
- Change: +52 words (new section entirely)

### Implementation Notes:
- **INSPIRED BY:** House of Sonder AI's "Starting At £749" transparency
- Place near bottom of page (before final CTA)
- Shows tiered approach (Discovery → Tier 3 → Tier 4)
- Emphasizes ROI and guarantee
- Self-qualifies prospects (filters out Tier 1-2 seekers)
- Visual suggestion: 3 pricing boxes or simple list format

---

## 9. FAQ SECTION

### Current State: ✅ KEEP (with updates)

**What's Currently There:**
```
FAQ section exists (good structure)
Addresses objections like "I'm not a tech person"

Estimated word count: 150-200 words
```

### ✅ What Works:
- Addresses key objection ("not a tech person")
- Good trust-building element
- Q&A format is scannable

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Likely too verbose (not House of Sonder AI concise style)
- Missing transformation vs. automation differentiation questions
- No diagnostic/partnership positioning

### New Transformation Copy:

**Updated FAQ (Concise Version):**

```
How is this different from automation agencies?
Most agencies ask "what can we automate?" and start building. I ask "what's actually broken?" and start diagnosing.

I'm not a tech person. Will this work?
This approach is better for non-technical owners. We start with business problems you understand, not technical solutions you shouldn't have to.

What if I know what I want automated?
Perfect — let's start there. But I'll also ask diagnostic questions to ensure we're solving the right problem.

How long does transformation take?
Discovery: 2-4 weeks. Design: 2-4 weeks. Implementation: 4-12 weeks. But you'll see measurable outcomes within 30-60 days.
```

**Word Count:** 117 words (4 Q&As)

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: ~150-200 words
- New: 117 words
- Change: -33 to -83 words (22-42% reduction)

### Implementation Notes:
- Keep existing FAQ structure/layout

- Visual suggestion: Accordion or simple Q&A list

---

```
CTA: "Work With Us →"
Supporting text likely generic

Estimated word count: 30-40 words
```

### ✅ What Works:
- Clear CTA button
- Simple layout

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Generic CTA text ("Work With Us")
- Missing diagnostic/discovery language
- No emphasis on free discovery session
- No restatement of value proposition

### New Transformation Copy:

**Updated Final CTA:**

```
READY TO TRANSFORM YOUR BUSINESS?

Book a 60-minute discovery call. No sales pitch, just diagnostic questions that reveal what's actually broken in your operations.

[BOOK YOUR DISCOVERY CALL] (Free)
```

**Word Count:** 32 words

### Text Length Comparison:
- Current: ~30-40 words
- New: 32 words
- Change: Similar length, higher impact

### Implementation Notes:
- Keep existing CTA layout/structure
- Replace "Work With Us" → "BOOK YOUR DISCOVERY CALL"
- Add "(Free)" next to button
- Emphasize diagnostic discovery language
- Keep ultra-concise
- Visual suggestion: Centered, bold headline, prominent button

- Sections: 5-6 sections

### New Transformation Homepage (Recommended):
- Total word count: ~750-850 words
- Average section length: 60-90 words
- Sections: 10 sections (added 5 critical sections)

### Why Word Count Increased:
**Added 5 critical sections that didn't exist:**
1. "Most Automation Builds The Wrong Thing" (+52 words)
2. "My Background" (+67-106 words depending on option)
3. "Real Transformations" (+138 words)
4. "Diagnosis First, Always" (+79 words)
5. "Starting At £5K" (+52 words)

**Total additions:** +388-437 words

**Reduced/optimized existing sections by ~100-150 words**

**Net increase:** +250-300 words

### Key Metrics:
- **Text per section:** 40-50% shorter per section (more impactful)
- **Total sections:** Increased from 5-6 to 10 (better story)
- **Impact:** Higher (transformation vs. automation positioning)

---

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1: CRITICAL (Do These First)
These sections are missing entirely and represent biggest gaps:

1. **"My Background" Section** ← Biggest gap vs. House of Sonder AI
2. **"Real Transformations" Case Studies** ← Second biggest gap
3. **"Diagnosis First, Always" Philosophy** ← Key differentiation
4. **Hero Section Update** ← First impression transformation

**Rationale:** These 4 sections establish your unique positioning and differentiation.

### Phase 2: HIGH PRIORITY
These sections exist but need transformation:

5. **"How We Work" Process Section** ← Replace timeline with step-based process
6. **"What We Offer" Services Section** ← Replace features with pain points & solutions
7. **FAQ Updates** ← Add transformation vs. automation Q&As

**Rationale:** These sections work structurally but need copy transformation.

### Phase 3: NICE TO HAVE
These add credibility but aren't critical:

8. **"Starting At £5K" Pricing Section** ← Transparency builds trust
9. **"Most Automation Builds The Wrong Thing"** ← Differentiation section
10. **Final CTA Update** ← Minor improvement

**Rationale:** These enhance positioning but aren't make-or-break.
