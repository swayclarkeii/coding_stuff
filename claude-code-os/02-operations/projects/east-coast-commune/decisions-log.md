## Detailed Decision Records

### Decision #1: Admin Automation Focus
**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Decision Maker:** Jenna (with Sway's guidance)
**Status:** ✅ Decided

**Context:**
During discovery call, two potential paths emerged:
1. Physical kitchen assistance (shopping, inventory, grunt work)
2. Administrative automation (email, social media, accounting, scheduling)

**Decision:**
Focus project on administrative automation (Option 2)

**Rationale:**
- Sway's expertise is in automation/AI, not physical labor coordination
- Admin pain points are clearer and more quantifiable
- Physical help requires local hiring, not consultant services
- Tech solutions can scale; physical help doesn't
- Multiple admin pain points identified (accounting, coordination, catering)

**Impact:**
- Project scope defined as digital systems and automation
- Physical preferences (Jenna's paper needs) become constraints, not blockers
- Budget focused on tools/implementation rather than labor costs

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Hybrid approach (some physical, some admin) - Rejected as unfocused
- Physical-only - Rejected as outside consultant expertise

### Decision #2: Partnership Dashboard Priority
**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Decision Maker:** Jenna
**Status:** ✅ Decided

**Context:**
Three major pain points identified:
1. Accounting/receipt management (2 hrs/week)
2. Partnership coordination (double-bookings, information silos)
3. Catering lead management (1-2 hrs/week)

**Decision:**
Partnership dashboard is the #1 priority despite accounting being Jenna's stated initial concern

**Jenna's Key Quote:**
> "That would be the biggest issue. It's not what I want to say, but I think it is the biggest issue."

**Rationale:**
- Double-bookings are actively occurring (recent Christmas party example)
- Relationship strain evident ("Is he going to move to Germany with you?")
- New venue will 2-3x the coordination complexity
- Accounting is annoying; coordination breakdown is business-threatening
- Both Derek and Jenna need visibility, not just Jenna

**Impact:**
- Phase 1 = Dashboard implementation
- Phase 2 = Accounting automation (still important, sequenced second)
- Phase 3 = Catering system
- Budget prioritization follows this sequence

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Accounting first (Jenna's initial instinct) - Rejected as less urgent
- All three simultaneously - Rejected as too complex, no quick wins
- Catering first - Rejected as lower impact

**Follow-up Needed:**
- Confirm with Derek in second discovery call (Sway only spoke with Jenna)
- Ensure both partners agree on priority

### Decision #3: Phased Implementation Approach
**Date:** December 10, 2025 (Post-Call Analysis)
**Decision Maker:** Sway (to be validated with client)
**Status:** ✅ Decided (pending client approval)

**Context:**
- Multiple interconnected pain points
- Budget constraints (3 mortgages)
- Time constraints (new venue opening Feb-Mar)
- Limited capacity for testing/implementation

**Decision:**
Three-phase implementation:
- **Phase 1:** Partnership Dashboard (Immediate)
- **Phase 2:** Accounting Automation (High Priority)
- **Phase 3:** Catering Lead System (Medium Priority)
- **Phase 4:** Optimization (Future/Optional)

**Rationale:**
- Allows quick win (dashboard) to build trust
- Spreads costs over time (budget constraint)
- Enables learning from each phase
- Client can opt out after any phase if ROI insufficient
- Reduces implementation burden (time constraint)
- Ensures Phase 1 completes before venue opening chaos

**Impact:**
- Proposal structured with phase-based pricing
- Each phase has independent value proposition
- Client can prioritize budget allocation
- Implementation timeline: 6-10 weeks total (if all phases approved)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single large implementation - Rejected as risky, expensive, complex
- Dashboard + Accounting combined in Phase 1 - Rejected as too much, delays quick win
- Different phase order - Rejected based on Jenna's stated priority

**Risks:**
- Client may only approve Phase 1, limiting total revenue
- Phases may reveal dependencies requiring rework
- New venue opening may interrupt phases 2-3

## PENDING DECISIONS

### Decision #4: Dashboard Tool Selection
**Target Date:** December 14, 2025
**Decision Maker:** Sway (recommendation) + Jenna & Derek (approval)
**Status:** ⏳ Pending Research

**Options:**
1. **Google Sheets + Google Calendar**
   - Pros: Free, cloud-based, real-time sync, accessible anywhere, collaborative
   - Cons: Requires Google account, internet dependent, learning curve

2. **Excel + Shared OneDrive/Dropbox**
   - Pros: Familiar to Jenna (already uses Excel), powerful, offline capable
   - Cons: Sync delays, version conflicts, requires subscription (OneDrive/Dropbox)

3. **Airtable**
   - Pros: Database-like power, beautiful interfaces, automation capabilities
   - Cons: Cost (~$20/user/month), learning curve, may be overkill

**Decision Criteria:**
- Ease of use (must be adopted by both partners)
- Mobile accessible but not mobile-required (Jenna's preference)
- Printable (Jenna's security blanket)
- Real-time or near-real-time updates
- Cost (budget constraints)
- Setup speed (timeline pressure)

**Information Needed:**
- Derek's tool preferences
- Current Google/Microsoft ecosystem usage
- Internet reliability at business location
- Budget for monthly subscriptions

**Next Steps:**
- Create mockup in Google Sheets (free to demo)
- Present in second discovery call
- Get feedback on interface and access method

### Decision #5: Accounting Tool Selection
**Target Date:** December 15, 2025
**Decision Maker:** Sway (recommendation) + Jenna (approval)
**Status:** ⏳ Pending Research

**Options:**
1. **Expensify**
   - Pros: AI-powered scanning, ~$5/month, mobile-first, modern
   - Cons: Must verify Nova Scotia tax compatibility, Jenna hasn't tried it

2. **QuickBooks Self-Employed**
   - Pros: Accountant-friendly, established, comprehensive
   - Cons: Jenna tried and abandoned (tax separation issues), more expensive (~$15-20/month)

3. **Wave Accounting**
   - Pros: Free, Canadian company, receipt scanning included
   - Cons: Less sophisticated AI, unknown Nova Scotia tax handling

4. **Dext (Receipt Bank)**
   - Pros: Accountant-focused, strong receipt processing
   - Cons: Cost (~$10-30/month), may be overkill for this stage

**Decision Criteria:**
- Nova Scotia tax rule handling (food vs non-food)
- Receipt scanning accuracy
- Export format for year-end accountant
- Monthly cost
- Mobile app quality (receipt photo capture)
- Integration with dashboard

**Research Required:**
- Test Expensify with Nova Scotia tax scenarios
- Confirm Wave's Canadian tax handling
- Compare scanning accuracy across tools
- Get accountant's input on preferred export formats

**Validation Needed:**
- Jenna's willingness to try Expensify (given QuickBooks failure)
- Actual tax categorization requirements from accountant
- Budget approval for monthly subscription

### Decision #6: Form Builder for Catering

3. **Dubsado**
   - Pros: Nicole (A Mother's Touch) uses it, built for service businesses, contracts/invoicing included
   - Cons: $40-60/month, complex setup, may be overkill for ECC needs

4. **Jotform**
   - Pros: Good middle ground, conditional logic, affordable (~$34/month)
   - Cons: Less modern UI than Typeform

**Decision Criteria:**
- Mobile-friendly (most inquiries from phones)
- Conditional logic (show venue menu vs off-site menu based on location answer)
- Special request field handling
- Integration with email/dashboard
- Cost vs value
- Setup simplicity (time constraint)

**Next Steps:**
- Defer until Phase 3 approved

### Decision #7: Phase 1 Budget Approval
**Target Date:** December 20, 2025 (Target)
**Decision Maker:** Jenna & Derek
**Status:** ⏳ Pending Second Discovery Call

**Context:**
- Phased approach defined
- Phase 1 = Dashboard implementation
- Need budget approval to proceed

**Options:**
