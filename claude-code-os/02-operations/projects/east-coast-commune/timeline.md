## Risk Timeline

### Upcoming Risks

**December 2025:**
- ⚠️ Holiday availability (both client and consultant)
- ⚠️ Venue prep intensifying (distracts from project)
- ⚠️ Budget approval may delay into January

**January 2026:**
- ⚠️ Venue opening preparation ramps up
- ⚠️ Final construction/contractor coordination
- ⚠️ Phase 1 must complete before chaos escalates

**February-March 2026:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL:** New venue opening
- 🔴 Physical move from old location
- 🔴 All attention on opening successfully
- 🔴 Systems must be working before this hits

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Complete Phase 1 by Jan 15:**
   - Creates buffer before venue opening
   - Allows 2-4 weeks of stable use before chaos
   - Reduces dependency risk

2. **Flexible Phase 2-3 Timing:**
   - Can defer to post-opening if needed
   - Phase 1 provides minimum viable improvement
   - Client can focus on opening without guilt

3. **Support During Opening:**
   - Extra availability during move week
   - Quick-response for any system issues
   - Expect some system usage to drop temporarily

4. **Post-Opening Check-in:**
   - Schedule follow-up 2-4 weeks after opening
   - Assess system usage under new conditions
   - Adjust/optimize for new reality
   - Discuss Phase 2-3 readiness
