# East Coast Commune - Project Brief

**Client:** Jenna & Derek
**Company:** East Coast Commune
**Industry:** Hospitality (Bar/Restaurant/Catering)
**Location:** Nova Scotia, Canada
**Project Start:** December 3, 2025
**Status:** 🟡 Discovery → Proposal Phase

---

## Client Overview

### Business Profile
- **Type:** Bar, restaurant, and catering services
- **Current Stage:** Pop-up location transitioning to permanent venue
- **Team:** 2 owners + 2 staff (work only, no management)
- **Timeline:** New venue opening February-March 2025

### Key Contacts
- **Jenna:** Operations, catering, accounting, scheduling, payroll
- **Derek:** Social media, marketing, bar events, advertising

---

## Project Vision

Transform East Coast Commune's operational infrastructure from fragmented manual systems to unified digital workflows that enable partnership coordination, financial visibility, and scalable growth as they transition to their new permanent venue.

---

## Core Problems

### 1. Partnership Communication Breakdown (CRITICAL)
**Impact:** Double-bookings, information silos, relationship strain
**Current State:** Physical calendar + scattered notes + separate information streams
**Desired State:** Unified dashboard with real-time visibility for both partners

### 2. Manual Accounting Overhead (HIGH)
**Impact:** 2+ hours/week, procrastination, financial opacity
**Current State:** Manual Excel entry, receipt accumulation, delayed visibility
**Desired State:** Automated receipt capture and real-time expense tracking

### 3. Catering Lead Management (MEDIUM)
**Impact:** 1-2 hours/week, manual qualification and quoting
**Current State:** Email forwarding, manual responses, paper tracking
**Desired State:** Qualification forms, automated menu delivery, centralized tracking

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Partnership Coordination:**
   - Zero double-bookings
   - Both partners can see all events, bills, schedules in real-time
   - Less than 5 minutes to add/update information

2. **Accounting Efficiency:**
   - Reduce receipt processing time by 75% (from 2 hours to 30 minutes/week)
   - Real-time financial dashboard visibility
   - Eliminate receipt-related stress/nightmares

3. **Catering Operations:**
   - Reduce lead management time by 50% (from 15-20 to 7-10 minutes per lead)
   - Auto-qualify leads before human involvement
   - Maintain Jenna's ability to handle custom requests

4. **Scalability:**
   - Systems ready before new venue opens (Feb-Mar 2025)
   - Can handle 2-3x current volume without additional overhead
   - Works for both physical (Jenna) and digital (Derek) preferences

---

## Constraints & Considerations

### Budget Constraints
- Currently paying 3 mortgages simultaneously
- Cash flow tight until new venue opens
- Need clear ROI justification for investments

### Time Constraints
- Both partners fully occupied with operations + new venue prep
- Limited capacity for implementation/testing
- Must work alongside ongoing business operations

### Technical Constraints
- Jenna prefers physical/tactile systems (transitioning to digital)
- Must accommodate both partners' different work styles
- Nova Scotia-specific requirements (tax rules, local suppliers)

### Timeline Pressure
- New venue opening in 2-3 months
- Current systems will catastrophically fail at larger scale
- Implementation window is NOW

---

## Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Partnership Dashboard (IMMEDIATE)
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Priority:** Critical

Components:
- Shared calendar (bar events + catering)
- Bills due tracking
- Revenue/expense visibility
- Staff schedule
- Payroll tracking

**Quick Win:** Prevent double-bookings, reduce meeting chaos

### Phase 2: Accounting Automation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks after Phase 1
**Priority:** High

Components:
- Receipt capture system (Expensify or similar)
- Auto-categorization (Nova Scotia tax rules)
- Real-time expense dashboard
- Export for annual accountant handoff

**Quick Win:** Eliminate receipt nightmares, save 1.5 hours/week

### Phase 3: Catering Lead System (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks after Phase 2
**Priority:** Medium

Components:
- Dedicated catering@ email
- Qualification form (party size, date, type, budget)
- Auto-menu delivery based on responses
- Centralized tracking (printable for Jenna)
- Integration with dashboard calendar

**Quick Win:** Save 30-60 minutes/week, auto-filter incompatible leads

### Phase 4: Optimization (FUTURE)
**Timeline:** Post venue opening
**Priority:** Low

- Price comparison system (if ROI justifies)
- Advanced reporting
- Vendor coordination
- Additional integrations

---

## Technical Stack (To Be Determined)

### Under Consideration:
- **Dashboard:** Google Sheets + Google Calendar OR Excel + shared folder
- **Accounting:** Expensify OR QuickBooks (if Nova Scotia tax compatible)
- **Catering Forms:** Google Forms, Typeform, or Dubsado-style integration
- **Communication:** Email routing, possibly Slack for internal updates

### Selection Criteria:
1. Ease of use (both partners must adopt it)
2. Mobile accessible but not mobile-dependent (Jenna's preference)
3. Cost-effective (budget constraints)
4. Quick setup (timeline pressure)
5. Supports both real-time digital AND printable physical outputs

---

## Key Stakeholders

### Internal (East Coast Commune)
- **Jenna:** Primary day-to-day user, operations manager
- **Derek:** Secondary user, bar/events manager
- **Staff (2):** Minimal interaction, schedule visibility only

### External
- **Accountant:** Year-end recipient of financial data
- **Catering Customers:** Interact with qualification forms
- **Suppliers:** Indirect (if price comparison implemented)

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Venue opening consumes all attention | High | Implement Phase 1 before venue prep intensifies |
| Budget constraints delay project | Medium | Show quick wins first, phase implementations |
| Jenna resists digital transition | High | Maintain "security blankets" (printable outputs, gradual transition) |
| Derek doesn't engage with system | Medium | Involve Derek in solution design, ensure it matches his workflow |
| Systems don't integrate well | Medium | Choose tools known for integration or use manual bridges initially |
| Implementation time unavailable | High | Keep setup under 5 hours total, automate wherever possible |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1 (Dec 4-10):**
   - Research Expensify Nova Scotia compatibility
   - Design dashboard mockup (Excel/Google Sheets)
   - Map catering form flow
   - Estimate costs

2. **Week 2 (Dec 11-17):**
   - Schedule second discovery call with both Jenna & Derek
   - Present solution proposals
   - Get priority confirmation
   - Discuss budget and timeline

3. **Week 3+ (Dec 18+):**
   - Begin Phase 1 implementation
   - Target completion before January 15 (venue prep ramp-up)
