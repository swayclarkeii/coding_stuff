- **Type:** Pain Point
- **Priority:** High
- **Actionable:** Yes - Phase 2 accounting automation addresses this
- **Response:** Recommended Expensify for photo-based receipt capture

---

**Feedback:** "I have zero interest in [accounting]. I will do it and I can do it and I have a degree in economics, but I really only went to school to play basketball so I didn't care or pay attention."

- **Type:** Context / Constraint
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Actionable:** Yes - Design solution requiring minimal accounting knowledge
- **Response:** Focus on visual dashboards vs detailed bookkeeping

---

**Feedback:** "I want to see the final numbers. I don't want to be the person that is figuring out how they come."

- **Type:** Requirements / Preference
- **Priority:** High
- **Actionable:** Yes - Dashboard should show insights, not require analysis
- **Response:** Phase 1 dashboard includes revenue/expense summaries, not raw data entry

---

#### On QuickBooks Previous Attempt

**Feedback:** "We did have a program like that [receipt scanning]. At first I was like, oh, this is glorious. But then I came—so my issue with that is I had to go in and modify almost all of the receipts anyway because the tax thing was different on certain products."

- **Actionable:** Yes - Test accounting tool with this specific scenario
- **Response:** Add to research checklist: Nova Scotia food vs non-food tax handling

---

**Feedback:** "Because I was like, well, if I'm doing this anyway, why am I paying for the program if I have to go in and modify it? That's just annoying to me. I'm going to do it my way because that's easier for me."

- **Type:** Value Objection / Trust Issue
- **Priority:** High
- **Actionable:** Yes - Solution must actually save time, not add work
- **Response:** Focus on net time savings, not just digitization. Verify automation accuracy before recommending.
