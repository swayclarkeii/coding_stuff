## Critical Path

1. **Proposal Phase** → Eugene approves (blocker if rejected)
2. **Contract Phase** → Payment received (blocker without payment)
3. **Development Phase** → 95% AI accuracy achieved (blocker if accuracy too low)
4. **Testing Phase** → Eugene satisfied with results (blocker if major issues)
5. **Launch Phase** → Production stable (blocker if critical bugs)

**Biggest Risk to Timeline:** AI accuracy below 95% could require additional training/refinement time
