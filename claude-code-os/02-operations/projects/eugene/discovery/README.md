## Quick Reference

### What Eugene Needs
1. **18 document types** automatically identified and labeled
2. **Checklist** showing what's present vs. missing
3. **Organized folders** replacing manual work
4. **PipeDrive integration** for automatic deal updates
5. **80% time reduction** from 5-10 hours to 1-2 hours per deal

### The "Aha Moment"
> **Sway:** "What if you just forward the email to a special address, and the system automatically does all of that for you?"
>
> **Eugene:** "Are you fucking kidding me? That's exactly what I need!"

### Why It Works
- ✅ Eugene already uses ChatGPT (proof of concept)
- ✅ German documents have standardized formats (high AI accuracy)
- ✅ No client training needed (email forwarding only)
- ✅ Integrates with existing tools (PipeDrive, Motion)
- ✅ Strong ROI (3-6 month payback)
- ✅ Phased approach (Phase 1 core, Phase 2 enhancement)
