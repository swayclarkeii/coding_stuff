# Meeting Analysis - Eugene Proposal Review
**Date:** 2025-12-15

## Executive Summary
Sway presented the formal proposal for automating Eugene's debt advisory document processing. Eugene agreed to the 3-phase approach with development starting January 5, 2025. Phase 1 (document detection for 4 core documents) will be a free trial in exchange for a testimonial, with future phases valued at ~€2,500 each.

## Key Discussion Points

- Personal discussion about Portugal move plans (summer 2027)

## Decisions Made
