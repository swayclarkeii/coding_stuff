### Opening Discussion (00:00 - 09:10)
*Discussion about meeting recording tools (Fathom vs Fireflies vs Granola) and birthday party celebrations*

Eugene
00:02
A new meeting record, what's wrong with the old one?
Sway Clarke
00:06
The old one I was using, I had to do a bit too much manual stuff because I was actually using ChatGPT.
Eugene
00:19
Okay.
Sway Clarke
00:20
I would record the calls on ChatGPT, but then I had to manually take the transcript and put it into another platform in order to work with it.
Sway Clarke
00:33
With Fathom, what I'm testing out is I can automate the whole process. It records the meeting, but then after it records, I could push it directly into an LLM or into a drive so it downloads as a file in a particular place.
Eugene
00:57
Okay.
Sway Clarke
00:58
Currently with GPT, I can't do that.
Eugene
01:02
Okay.
Sway Clarke
01:04
So I'm just testing things out, trying to see how it works. This is what I do all day.
Eugene
01:14
But what's up with Fireflies? I mean...
Sway Clarke
01:18
Fireflies is cool, but it's not what I need.
Sway Clarke
01:26
It's good for teams, like if you're working with a big team, because their pricing doesn't really make much sense.
Eugene
01:34
Okay.
Sway Clarke
01:35
What I need it for is just to record as an individual and download it. For example, with Fireflies on their free version, you only get three
Sway Clarke
01:45
transcripts a month or something like that.
Eugene
01:48
Okay.
Sway Clarke
01:50
Whereas with Atom, you get unlimited transcripts, for example.
Eugene
01:54
Okay.
Sway Clarke
01:54
And then if you go up to the paid version of Fireflies—
Eugene
01:55
Oh, okay.
Sway Clarke
01:58
It's cool, but then I'm like, why am I paying for this when I could use the other program, Fathom? Fathom is pretty interesting.
Eugene
02:08
Okay, I have to check it out as well.
Eugene
02:11
I'm using Firefox, but it was just because at that time, I mean, I'm using it right now, at least a year.
Eugene
02:20
Probably. And it was connected to Aircall, so that's why I haven't even tried another one I had heard of.
Eugene
02:31
Something else.
Eugene
02:37
I put it on my to-do list, but...
Eugene
02:40
As these fucking to-do lists.
Eugene
02:42
Wait a second.
Eugene
02:44
Hey, granola.
Sway Clarke
02:46
Granola, oh that's another one. There's so many—there's Otter, Fireflies, Granola, Tapioca.
Eugene
02:55
I don't know, it's a lot. Let me check, but I think it was Granola.
Eugene
03:03
Yeah, also AI Notepad for people back-to-back in meetings. I don't know.
Sway Clarke
03:09
Yeah, there's just so many. There's just apps and apps and apps.
Sway Clarke
03:16
Yo, we're not...
Eugene
03:16
It's kind of, I mean, it makes sense that it's just another bubble.
Sway Clarke
03:23
Yeah.
Eugene
03:24
Like literally.
Eugene
03:25
Just keep it updated with this AI. It's a full-time job.
Sway Clarke
03:29
A hundred percent.
Eugene
03:30
Just keeping updated.
Sway Clarke
03:31
Yeah, 100%.
Eugene
03:32
Not using it, I'm not saying using it, just keeping updated, just knowing what's out there—it's like a full-time job. Oh yeah, I know about this, yeah, I know, but
Eugene
03:42
No experience, you know, and that is.
Sway Clarke
03:45
There are people, and that's the thing, you see this also with a lot of these YouTubers. There are people that just
Sway Clarke
03:56
keep up with the programs, the platforms, and just rate the platforms. So you got to check this out. I'm like, but you don't do anything else other than test out these platforms. You don't even use them, right? You're just talking about them. And then you got people like myself that are like, okay, let's take these platforms and use them to build stuff. But I don't have time to chase morale and stuff, and you realize that a lot of it doesn't work anyway.
Eugene
04:20
It's crazy.
Sway Clarke
04:20
And what you don't want to do, the one thing you really don't want to do, is build something for clients and then that company goes under.
Sway Clarke
04:32
And then the whole workflow is gone. You have to really be like, is this company working? Is this for the long haul? What's their investor situation? What's their debt like?
Eugene
04:42
I mean, speaking of ChatGPT, maybe two days ago—
Eugene
04:48
Two days ago, I really recognized that it's been kind of slow or like, what the fuck?
Eugene
04:55
It takes forever to just give me a fucking answer and I'm like, what's going on? Maybe a lot of usage right now. Let me check right now if it's working again.
Eugene
05:06
And then I'm like, okay, fuck. Speaking of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and who's the other? I've never used it—Grok. I've never opened it in my life.
Eugene
05:22
I'm like, wow, just these four big players, it's bananas. Just to keep up with them, and then not to talk about Granola, Phantom, Fireflies.
Eugene
05:31
Whatever. I hope you had a great birthday, which—
Sway Clarke
05:36
Bro.
Eugene
05:37
With the white folks and—
Sway Clarke
05:39
This is, man. This is, man.
Eugene
05:41
Smiling and shaking hands and being—
Sway Clarke
05:44
That's what's up. My daughter loved it. She wanted a mango, apple,
Sway Clarke
05:55
vanilla pudding cake shaped like a dog, blue, and she got it. I was like, here you go, I'm gonna make this, I'm gonna bake this, here you go, boom, and it was all good. The problem was my wife was stressing out, obviously. I was like, look, I'm not going to talk to you about this now, but I didn't want to do a party. You wanted to do a party.
Sway Clarke
06:15
And if this is how it's going to be every fucking year, I'm not doing a project.
Eugene
06:18
We're not going to have sex.
Sway Clarke
06:19
When are you going to do the party? So either you're yelling at the kids all morning, like, yo, it's your birthday party today.
Eugene
06:21
No, it's—
Sway Clarke
06:29
I'm like, every year it's gonna be like this, six, seven. When I was a kid, my mother used to just yell every day on my birthday, like the whole morning. No, I'm not doing that.
Eugene
06:38
Bye.
Sway Clarke
06:39
Not doing that, not doing that. But no, it was good, it was good, it was good. How was your—did you hit up the Winox?
Eugene
06:49
Jesus fucking Christ, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Eugene
06:54
Cultural, cultural bravo, right? I was there for—what was it—the last time I spoke and that's it. That's it, I've done it. Been there, done that, check for this year. I'm not, I'm not sway, you know, going under carousels and what the fuck. No, I'm not.
Sway Clarke
07:07
Every week. Every week.
Eugene
07:10
No, no, no, I'm like, hey honey, I've been there, even with your mom, so it counts like quadruple, right? It didn't count quadruple, it's like, hey, you owe me.
Sway Clarke
07:15
Ooh.
Sway Clarke
07:18
That's wrong.
Eugene
07:21
And
Eugene
07:24
No, with the birthday thing, like Stella, I don't know if you remember my wife. I literally told her to shut off her shop and just do a new business with catering and events because this seems like what she's into.
Sway Clarke
07:42
Make money with.
Eugene
07:42
With the ice cream, with the Einschulung, now that you're talking about it, she's like, people would actually just go to eat with grandparents.
Eugene
07:53
For six of them, we had, like literally, it's not a number just out there. We literally had 50 people in our courtyard with the Huftburg.
Eugene
08:13
Wow. I mean, like, you know, very speechless, and guess who's the one carrying the stuff. I don't know.
Eugene
08:26
I hate like 90%, 95% of the people. I just like, what the fuck? Why do I have to talk with them?
Sway Clarke
08:34
Pay for them, pay for them to eat your food, bro.
Eugene
08:34
Be nice.
Sway Clarke
08:39
Yo!
Eugene
08:39
And guess who's stressed about planning and everything. I'm like, hey, we could have just gone out to the Italian next door, grab a pizza.
Sway Clarke
08:51
Mood.
Eugene
08:51
Grandma will be happy. Granddad will be happy. We'll be happy.
Sway Clarke
08:55
Dude, call it.
Eugene
08:55
Done deal, all in all.
Eugene
09:00
100 euros, done deal. Happy family, let's go.
Eugene
09:05
We would spend just hundreds just on the Huftburg.
Sway Clarke
09:08
Bro.
Eugene
09:09
Yeah.

### Main Business Discussion Begins (09:10 - 12:53)

Sway Clarke
09:10
Let's jump in. All right. So look, I wanted to break this call up into two parts.
Eugene
09:11
That's cool.
Eugene
09:14
That's cool.
Sway Clarke
09:20
One part, the first part is I wanted to basically reconfirm a few things. I wanted to get your ideas on a few things. And then the second part will be more dedicated to what I've kind of thought about.
Sway Clarke
09:35
And how we can move forward. The first thing is I just wrote down questions here and there, so I'm just looking at them.
Eugene
09:38
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
09:43
I wanted to know, okay, so when you look at these parts, like we particularly looked at these first two parts, actually, what do you—
Sway Clarke
09:51
Like these parts, like we particularly looked at these first two parts, actually. What do you—
Sway Clarke
09:54
In general, what is for you the biggest bottleneck in your whole process, not even just this, because I don't even want to just focus on this. I want to make sure, because why I'm asking you these questions is because at the end of the day, this is really about your value. At the end of the day, I want to produce something for you that you're like, this just absolutely saved me time. And this was actually the problem that I needed to solve.
Eugene
10:14
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
10:19
Right, so my question would be, in general, what is your biggest bottleneck? When you look at your day-to-day, your week-to-week, what is it? What's that thing?
Eugene
10:19
Hmm.
Eugene
10:37
It's the biggest burden, I guess, actually. Analysis of the data.
Sway Clarke
10:45
The analysis of the data.
Eugene
10:48
I'm just going through a whole lot in my head, like hundreds of bottlenecks.
Eugene
11:00
On my day-to-day, it's like literally, yeah. A quick analysis I obviously do with ChatGPT now.
Eugene
11:07
But in the first—
Eugene
11:13
Nah, that's bullshit. I think the verification of the checklist.
Eugene
11:19
I think the verification of the checklist.
Eugene
11:27
Because getting into ChatGPT, there's like two steps or even three that have to be done up front. And this is the checklist. This is the requirements, what I need to even go forward.
Eugene
11:45
And it costs a lot of time, a lot of time to check if I have this checklist before I can run the analysis. I mean, it makes no sense. You can't just write stupid prompts and then hope for the best. So really, to go to ChatGPT, which would be like the third step—
Eugene
12:05
When I'm just looking at it right now, it's really having the checklist.
Eugene
12:13
Not to say almost completed, but to really understand, do I have everything I need right now to see if this deal makes sense or not.
Sway Clarke
12:21
Okay, so as I understand, what you're saying is the biggest problem is you got to get these documents, you have a list of them, you got to get them from the client and back and forth.
Eugene
12:22
Okay.
Sway Clarke
12:29
And figuring out whether you have all the right documents takes up the most time and is the biggest bottleneck. And to say outside of these parts we talked about, this is still a big bottleneck, even if you compare it to parts further down the road, two or three months down the road.
Eugene
12:29
Mm-hmm.
Eugene
12:36
Yeah.
Sway Clarke
12:46
Verify.
Sway Clarke
12:53
Okay.

### Document Verification Deep Dive (12:54 - 17:08)

Eugene
12:54
Because the thing is—
Eugene
12:59
It's as you said. You can't just rely on a tool, on a so-called AI tool, refer it to a client and then this whole thing blows up. I would build my whole thing on Excel and now Google is dead, now what am I going to do? It's kind of nonsense, right? And if I don't have—
Eugene
13:22
The required documents that I really need to screen. And the devil is really in the details. It's so much, I can't even, I don't want to go into the nuances. It's so stupid.
Eugene
13:36
It could be like a bargain immigrant who kills a deal and then you'll be wasting time, and then he sends you the bargain immigrant or he sends you some kind of messed up documents.
Eugene
13:46
And then you go through it and you're like—
Sway Clarke
13:48
Oh, shit.
Eugene
13:48
With a friend.
Sway Clarke
13:50
Oh shit.
Eugene
13:50
You see.
Sway Clarke
13:51
This is—
Eugene
13:53
And this is what I've been wasting time learning the hard way, going back and forth, still doing things, talking with the banks, although I don't have all the data. I'd be like, hey—
Eugene
14:04
Hey Mr. Clark, yeah, I got this deal, maybe we can push on, yeah, it's about this and this. Okay, send me that. Then I'll be going back and forth, hey Mr. Smith, Mr. Clark says you need this and this. Okay, then he sends me that. You have this or no, it will be ready next month. It will be ready in two days.
Eugene
14:20
And then I'm between keeping both sides warm and then managing the documents.
Eugene
14:26
And that's why I've learned a lot, lost a lot of money, lost a lot of serious money. And then I'm like, you know what, go and fuck yourself. If I don't have the things completed, it's just me. Hey, what?
Sway Clarke
14:37
Move on. Okay.
Eugene
14:38
And that's really—
Sway Clarke
14:42
the base.
Eugene
14:42
Really one of the basics and the biggest bottleneck right now, I thought like ChatGPT because it takes a while, but really to have this thing and you know it.
Eugene
14:55
Best at night, really to get the best out of these AI tools, name it whatever you want, complexity and whatever. You have to get your data on point, you have to feed them with the right information.
Eugene
15:10
Actually, like the agreements, the solution or whatever you're looking for.
Sway Clarke
15:14
Okay.
Eugene
15:15
If I can automate that, I don't even know if it's...
Eugene
15:21
I wouldn't even go that far to say I'm going to automate that. But you know, my kind of job is...
Eugene
15:29
Picture in my head where it comes to matching. Yeah, yes.
Sway Clarke
15:32
Let's go to me because now we're talking about the how, right? But the how you actually do it, I first want to just make sure it's the what. I want to make sure after I sit down for a week with this, I want to make sure that this is the thing that he wants to work on, like this is the problem. Because if we're working on something else and then I build that thing and then bring that to you and then you're like, oh that's cool but I still got this problem over here.
Eugene
15:48
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
15:55
Then we didn't hit the value, right? And I know one of the things you said last week was...
Eugene
15:56
No, no.
Eugene
15:58
Yeah.
Sway Clarke
16:03
I would love to hit, my goal is to get 15 clients a year. Right now I'm at six. I would love to have 15 clients a year. And so one of my questions has to do with...
Sway Clarke
16:15
Say you optimize all of these processes in the back end and you get more time. Now you have this time to get more clients. Do you have a machine...
Sway Clarke
16:25
Or a system to get more clients?
Sway Clarke
16:28
Do you already have that in place? Okay, because that's a big question.
Sway Clarke
16:34
Sometimes individuals or businesses are like, okay, I have these things that take up so much time and I wish I had more. What would you do if you had more time? Oh, I would get more clients. And then you're like, okay, so we pull this down...
Sway Clarke
16:47
But now you have more time, but now you don't have any way to get more clients.
Sway Clarke
16:52
And so now you have this time, but you don't have a machine to acquire more clients. Right. So my question would be...
Sway Clarke
16:59
It's something to think about because the moment you do have more time you're going to need to figure out how to get those clients. It's just that process.
Eugene
17:06

### Client Acquisition Discussion (17:08 - 21:23)

Sway Clarke
17:08
A lot of your clients, are they coming in versus, you're not doing advertising, I'm assuming.
Sway Clarke
17:15
So it's all referrals and warm leads.
Eugene
17:18
Yeah, the thing is, so right now you can imagine it's really like a gold rush. History has shown the guys who are doing the big bucks were the guys selling the shovels, or how you say it.
Sway Clarke
17:34
Selling the shovels, yeah.
Eugene
17:36
Yeah, the shovels, right?
Eugene
17:38
And it's literally like I don't even waste time on how do I get clients because I've been in my head with this. First of all, I would never go Facebook, LinkedIn and this kind of blah. The only platform was LinkedIn and I'm like, OK.
Eugene
17:52
Am I the next one the platform is waiting for, for AI generated content and bullshitting?
Eugene
18:01
I even had this thought on Saturday and it was really funny. We were at a place at Weihnachtsfeier.
Eugene
18:09
This is a topic for a different meeting. With all this AI stuff, it's going to be...
Eugene
18:18
100%. 100% is what I believe in. It's going to be more focused on human, on the personal connection.
Sway Clarke
18:26
100%.
Eugene
18:26
Because I got my man's way in the background doing all this kind of stuff which I don't understand. I just know that I put something in, then I get my solution. And getting clients, to answer your question straight up before I waste time, it's... Bro, right now it's...
Eugene
18:45
It's like taking a piss, it's that easy. If I wanted right now to fill up my week...
Sway Clarke
18:53
You could do it.
Eugene
18:55
Give me an hour, literally, I'm not bragging, give me an hour because everybody's looking for money, the big guys, the small guys. Everybody's looking for money, so you just call up any, like, hey, what's up...
Eugene
19:07
We got this capital lender, Sway Clark, Capital Partners. They are willing to give money into the market. Do you have any project that we can talk about? He's going to bring his friend, his cousin, and it's muted out right now.
Sway Clarke
19:19
Everybody's looking for investment, everybody's looking for money.
Eugene
19:23
It's crazy right now, and to answer your really intelligent question, this is where we come back to the bottleneck. The bottleneck is I can get...
Eugene
19:35
Literally, every time I have an appointment at Kudam...
Eugene
19:39
I pick up the phone. And I'm like, hey, I'm coming to Kudam maybe on Wednesday.
Eugene
19:45
Should we meet? Do we have anything on?
Eugene
19:48
100% have, like, who would thrive more at point, for instance?
Eugene
19:54
With cold clients, it's not like I even know them. I'll be like, hey, I'm there, I'm with this client, maybe you have some time to talk. So to get clients, it's referral, it's cold calling.
Eugene
20:06
Which I'm really easy with because I grew up with this cold calling nonsense. I don't really believe people click on LinkedIn and say, oh, wow, this guy has the 150th post out there, he must be...
Sway Clarke
20:16
No, I mean, it's not even when I say system and I know it thinks about this like AI generated, like what are you pumping out or doing ads? Everyone has their own system.
Sway Clarke
20:27
Right, like I have a buddy of mine who actually does the same kind of work that I'm doing right now and he's like, I don't even call warm leads, I just go to events.
Sway Clarke
20:36
I meet people and this is where I shine. This is where I get my clients, so everyone, I just wanted to make sure that I think sometimes for people it's...
Sway Clarke
20:45
It's always on the radar to kill the amount of processes and work that they have. But with the idea that they're going to get more leads, but then when they have that time, they're like, oh shit, I don't...
Sway Clarke
20:56
How am I going to get leads? You know what I mean? So if you're like, yo, my bottleneck, the leads are there. My bottleneck is I can't take them because I don't have the time, then that all makes sense. But I just wanted to make sure that again, we're working on the right value, we're working on the right problem. Because if I'm providing something for you that you're like, yeah, it was cool, but didn't really help me out much, then it's pointless to do it.
Eugene
21:20
Yeah.
Sway Clarke
21:23
I think...

### Process Timeline and Document Requirements (21:25 - 29:15)

Sway Clarke
21:25
Those are the questions I got. I remember also you mentioned that the process takes so long, like it could be between five or ten hours for every potential client that you have, right? Going through this process. Then there's the other processes that you have, right?
Sway Clarke
21:43
And so the real restriction or the real disadvantage is that you can't take on more clients, you can't make more money. Your game right now is to make more money and get more clients. So I think given that, what I was thinking about—
Eugene
21:52
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
21:57
I'll also share my screen.
Sway Clarke
22:01
There are a few things I was thinking about. The next part of this call is going to be, I have some more questions around the process.
Sway Clarke
22:10
What I call the what-ifs around the process. So share my—where am I?
Eugene
22:13
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
22:18
Here we go. So—
Sway Clarke
22:23
You can see this.
Eugene
22:25
Yeah, let me just put you on the bigger screen.
Sway Clarke
22:26
Okay.
Eugene
22:29
I'm old, you know, now it's just official and I can't push it around anymore, it's just—
Sway Clarke
22:31
And—
Eugene
22:36
Okay.
Sway Clarke
22:37
Okay, so let me get back to—where is my...
Sway Clarke
22:43
Where's my—
Eugene
22:44
Jesus, this is just about me.
Sway Clarke
22:47
This is just you. So let me—hang on, I'm trying to find my signal. Where did my signal go?
Eugene
22:51
Oh, well.
Sway Clarke
22:58
Why is it gone?
Sway Clarke
23:00
That's strange. Hang on for a second.
Sway Clarke
23:04
There it is. But why would it do that?
Sway Clarke
23:07
So let me see.
Sway Clarke
23:11
Appreciate it.
Sway Clarke
23:15
Entire screen, let me just go there.
Sway Clarke
23:19
Okay, so you can see me now, right? You can see it?
Sway Clarke
23:25
Okay, so.
Sway Clarke
23:27
What we're talking about here—this is your current workflow that I put together. Right. So you get your leads, yeah?
Eugene
23:33
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
23:36
Leads come to me.
Eugene
23:36
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
23:37
Email referrals, wherever it comes in. Then you send them an email or a notification saying, look, I need these documents from you.
Eugene
23:40
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
23:49
Right? And then the client has to bring you—give you 18. I think it was about 18 documents we were talking about, or maybe it might be less.
Eugene
23:49
Mm-hmm.
Eugene
23:56
It was—
Eugene
23:58
It depends, but 18 is a good job.
Sway Clarke
24:00
Okay.
Sway Clarke
24:01
Yeah, let's just say 18. And sorry, I remember this is also 18 for the first draft because once you do this, qualified, then you need to get more documents, right? Okay, you get this, you ask for these 18 documents, they give them back to you unlabeled and all kind of jumbled everywhere.
Eugene
24:19
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
24:19
Then you have to download all of these files onto your drive, onto your Google Drive or your computer.
Eugene
24:21
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
24:28
Then you open each PDF or file and determine, is it the Grundbuch, is this the BWA, what is this?
Eugene
24:28
Mm-hmm.
Eugene
24:38
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
24:39
And then you've got to label them all, yeah? So you've got to check them against what's missing. You have your full—I'm at 18. Okay, now I got 16, right? Oh, okay. Which 16 do I have? You have to literally open it, look at it.
Sway Clarke
24:52
Look at the name, make sure all of it's filled in properly, make sure all the information is there, close that, label it, put it to a folder that you want to put it into, right? And then once you've got all of those documents—
Eugene
25:01
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
25:05
Once you've got all the documents, then you take them and you upload them to ChatGPT.
Eugene
25:10
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
25:10
You then maybe cut and paste or you open ChatGPT and use the add file button. Then you go to your folder, add the files.
Sway Clarke
25:18
Pump them in, and then you have a prompt already.
Sway Clarke
25:23
You take that prompt and you cut that prompt from a document or a Google document, you put that into ChatGPT, you run the analysis.
Sway Clarke
25:33
And then the analysis will tell you whether it's—
Sway Clarke
25:43
As you know, your SWOT, like what are those things, it's up to give you a final analysis. Well, this is my question. Does the analysis automatically tell you red flags?
Sway Clarke
25:49
And then—
Eugene
25:50
Yes. So I use this agent mode where I just drop in and then it goes like, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, this is a red flag.
Eugene
26:01
And then also it drafts me questions that I need to be aware of, so it's like five to ten questions that I already have to address to the client after the analysis.
Sway Clarke
26:12
Okay, and these questions, it always gives you questions?
Eugene
26:17
Always.
Sway Clarke
26:18
Okay, so it'll give you questions and these questions will be—
Eugene
26:18
Always.
Sway Clarke
26:21
I guess my question is, are these negative or positive questions? Are you going back, you could be saying, hey, I need more information, or the questions could be, hey, what do you think about X, Y, and Z? Or, you know, you have different types of questions, but what am I trying to ask? I'm trying to ask right now, are these questions still in the process of verification? Like, are you sending them back questions in order to still determine whether they're going to be a client, or is the analysis already telling you whether they're a client or not?
Eugene
26:53
It's already telling me whether they're a client or not. It's more specific, like, hey, you need to be aware of—
Eugene
27:02
Just because it was there, this is the question, this is missing, or how much equity does this guy have, what's the timeline of the building construction, so it's already like—
Eugene
27:16
With this information that I've been given to ChatGPT, it's already drafting, and this is where we go back and forth. Because if I would have all documents completed—
Eugene
27:26
It would be maybe less questions, no questions, or just a recommendation, you know, just kill the deal. Makes no sense, right?
Sway Clarke
27:32
Okay, so in this part here, which is where—let me just move this back.
Sway Clarke
27:39
So in this part here, let me just—
Sway Clarke
27:44
At this—
Sway Clarke
27:50
So in this—let me just still—so in this part here, I guess it is—
Eugene
27:56
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
27:56
You get the analysis and then you have these questions, right?
Eugene
28:01
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
28:02
Okay, so these are the questions that you have to find out from him and then you're going to go back and forth with this. Okay, I've got some more questions, I got some more questions, and that's going to go all back.
Eugene
28:12
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
28:14
This also could be asking for more documents. Hey, I still need this document. Okay. And then, so the question I have here—okay, so at this point you could either, it could be a couple things already. You could decide this deal is not going to work, the documents that I have are not going to work out, I have to let this guy know that we're done, it's not a possibility to find someone else. Or it could be—
Sway Clarke
28:40
Oh, this looks promising. It looks okay. I still need a couple more documents and let me find out from them. So I'm going to ask questions or it could be, yo, this shit's dope.
Sway Clarke
28:53
All I need is this or I don't need anything more, we can proceed. Right. So you can have those different documents and then the rest of it actually is now you going back in these three scenarios.
Sway Clarke
29:01
To see what you gotta do. And then again,
Sway Clarke
29:07
I guess my question, yeah, okay, so that's it. So that's the process. And then you get down to yes or no, do I kill this thing or do I move forward?
Eugene
29:15
Mm-hmm.

### Minimum Document Requirements (29:16 - 33:18)

Sway Clarke
29:16
So I think what I have a couple of questions here that are as follows. So what happens if
Sway Clarke
29:26
you only get 12 documents, let's just say out of 18, you only get 12, do you proceed and go through
Sway Clarke
29:32
the whole process in terms of the analysis and getting that information only to ask them for the remaining six or do you actually say, no, I need more to even move forward from the document collection phase.
Sway Clarke
29:46
You understand what I'm saying?
Eugene
29:48
Yeah.
Eugene
29:50
This is really...
Eugene
29:54
It really depends.
Eugene
30:02
I always run the analysis based on the documents that I get.
Sway Clarke
30:05
Okay.
Eugene
30:07
For him to have it more on a hook like hey so far I know this, this and this and this makes sense
Eugene
30:13
I definitely need
Eugene
30:16
additional six documents in order to have like a real
Eugene
30:23
binding, you know, or to really go and proceed the process with the capital and otherwise we don't even need to proceed. Right now it's with me, I get it. We can do the chat, yada, yada, yada. But it's not like I say, hey,
Eugene
30:35
I need this 18, otherwise
Eugene
30:39
I don't know right now if I should really be like, okay, hey, boom,
Eugene
30:43
I needed these documents or we can proceed.
Sway Clarke
30:48
Well, we...
Eugene
30:48
Sometimes it's like
Sway Clarke
30:50
You don't necessarily need to go there. I just want to know currently how you're doing it because the way you could automate it, you could decide, for example, you can
Sway Clarke
31:00
say, hey, there are six or seven documents that I have to have.
Sway Clarke
31:06
And if I don't have these things, we can't go forward anyway. There's no point in me doing this. Right. So that would be my question. What if the client doesn't give you all the documents, but is there a minimum? Are there certain documents that you're like, I need this, I need your certificate, your passport?
Eugene
31:15
Oh, yeah.
Eugene
31:18
Yeah.
Eugene
31:22
Yeah, this definitely, this is definitely so even this
Eugene
31:28
You can even break it down to literally four or five documents. It's like the calculation, the teaser, the exit strategy.
Eugene
31:37
Yeah. So this is like, this is really no bullshit. Otherwise we really don't need to talk, literally.
Sway Clarke
31:42
And what are the five?
Eugene
31:49
So it's a project, like let's say teaser, it's like an expose. Then you have the calculation, which has to be a certain form, which some of them also just don't get. I don't understand, but it's the calculation, the teaser.
Eugene
32:02
Then I would say it's the Grundbuch, so the land register.
Eugene
32:08
That's three, and then you have an exit strategy, like how are you going to sell off, what's the idea of
Eugene
32:17
lender giving back his money if he gives you 10, 12, whatever million, what's the strategy in it. And then we can go to more in details, but this is like
Eugene
32:26
What is it about? What's your story? What's the calculation?
Eugene
32:30
How are you going to sell it? How is the lender going to get his money back? And literally, Grundbuch is really important to see who owns the land right now.
Eugene
32:41
So it could really break down to literally four or maximum five must-haves, otherwise don't even jump on a call. It makes no sense, right?
Sway Clarke
32:50
Okay.
Eugene
32:51
And then based on that, I can give a glimpse like, okay, it makes sense. According to the discrimination now,
Eugene
32:59
Boom, I need 18, I need 20 documents for this to make sense.
Sway Clarke
33:05
Okay.
Eugene
33:06
This would make sense and yeah, if he doesn't have all the docs then
Eugene
33:12
So I
Sway Clarke
33:14
Then it doesn't make sense.
Eugene
33:15
Makes no sense.
Sway Clarke
33:18
So there could be a situation where let's say it's an automated situation where, I mean, this gets to the next question. Well, actually, I'll talk in the next part.

### Automation System Proposal (33:27 - 44:32)

Sway Clarke
33:27
There could be a situation that you get the four documents or you don't get, like let's say you get the three documents and then you get another 12 of other stuff and you need these priority documents.
Sway Clarke
33:41
Before you get in the loop.
Sway Clarke
33:43
They get an email saying, I still need this one document anyway.
Sway Clarke
33:48
And you know what I'm saying? Like the automated system will say, you have these 12, you've got this one, but I still need this major document. Please provide it so I can book a call. This could happen where you get those four documents before you get into the mix.
Sway Clarke
34:05
To be like, okay, let's set up the modem, for example, right?
Sway Clarke
34:09
But why the minimum is important is because if there is a minimum, then it can allow the system to say, let this one through versus no, send another email to follow up to your one document. That way you don't have to get in the mix until you get those four or five documents, for example.
Eugene
34:23
Okay.
Sway Clarke
34:29
Because if a client is not sending to you, then it tells you something else too, right? So I don't need this.
Eugene
34:35
Yeah.
Eugene
34:38
It's so like literally, yeah. And not to waste time on this, this is what I learned the hard way is try to still squeeze in force and
Eugene
34:48
Although it's not really ready to go, you're still trying to and you're out there and you even shine yourself as more unprofessional because the banks will ask you for the stuff and then you're like, oh yeah, I have to get back to the client. Yeah.
Sway Clarke
35:04
And so, okay, so the last question, well, basically now let's jump over to what I'm kind of proposing.
Eugene
35:11
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
35:13
And it's a bit of a work in progress. So what I would kind of do is lay this out.
Sway Clarke
35:21
And then the idea would be to build a prototype, build a version of it that does this. We test it out, you go back and forth, test it out until it's finalized. So the time that is going to be needed from you would be to implement it, try it, give feedback, test it out. Okay, this works here, this part doesn't work, and get it refined over time. Leads arrive, you get the lead the same way—emails, calls, or reference. The question we would have here would be: does it make more sense for you or a response to go back to a client and give them a form where they upload all of these documents, or do they send them back to you by email and we pull the documents from an email? These are questions we would have to answer because we have to think about friction. You may say, you know what, if I send them a form, we can build this form, and if I put this into my workflow, this is going to be too much, like they're not going to fill out the form. Or it might be like, yeah, actually that's an easy way—they just give them a form, they have 18 documents, they upload each thing into a form. So this is just something to think about, different ways. You have to think about friction for you versus your client.
Sway Clarke
36:52
The client comes in, the lead comes in, you get notification, they get sent a request for the documents.
Sway Clarke
37:02
And then from there, the client either emails the documents or puts them into a form. It doesn't really matter. Let's go with email, the easy way. You get it in the email. What the system would look like is it would go into your emails, grab the documents, download the documents, put them into a folder, analyze the documents, label the documents, and re-put them into your final folder list, however you'd like. If documents are missing, it will send something back to the client to say, I need documents one through four or I still need this document. At this point, you get a light—a notification that says, hey, Eugene, you've got a client, he just put in all of his documents, everything's clean, you want to give them a follow-up. Then you could take that information, put that into your analysis, your ChatGPT manually, or you can check on it and it can go automatically into your analysis. The way I'm thinking about it is there are points in the flow where you are going to enter in, but your entering in is a check-in. It's not going to go completely automated without you. You just check in to make sure things are actually working for you, if you understand what I mean.
Eugene
38:27
I hope I correctly understand what you mean. I really hope. Are you saying this, for example, or does what you just described exist?
Sway Clarke
38:41
No, this is what I would build for you.
Eugene
38:45
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sway Clarke
38:46
What it would do is this. This is a basic idea of how it would work. You would get an email saying, Roger needs some money or whatever. You can do it a couple of ways. Roger gets an automated response: Hey Roger, what's going on? Can you send me these five documents or these 18 documents? However that is, just send them to me—email, form, whatever, that really doesn't matter. You're going to get all the documents somewhere. If you do it in a form, it's going to be into a drive. If you do it in your email, it's going to be in your email. So I set up a system that watches your email, says Roger just sent you 17 documents or 12 documents. It will download the documents, analyze the documents, because we know what a Grundbuch is, we know what a BWA is, we know what a PNL is. We have to train the system so it knows all of these things. When it comes in, let's just take the Grundbuch. It'll come in and say, okay, this is the Grundbuch, it's filled out correctly, it passes the test. It will take that document, name it, save it to your folders. Now Roger has a folder, he has all his documents in there, and you'll get an email that says all documents have been submitted by Roger, they've all been proofed. You'll go in, double proof them, just be like, okay, yep, this is done, I get everything I need. Then you can send the automation off again. You could set it up in a way that says maybe you respond, yeah, thank you, everything's good, go ahead with the automation. Now, the next part of the automation would be taking these files, pumping them into ChatGPT, your agent would then do that mix up, send you back out the results. Now you get the results however you want to look at it.
Eugene
40:45
Wait a second, can it automatically send it to the agent or is this like ChatGPT, or how does it—because I have built—
Sway Clarke
40:52
It can send it to—without getting technical, what I would do, I wouldn't do this anymore in ChatGPT that you're using. I would do it in a back-end version. I would just say, here are the documents. You have a prompt set up with your API call and your account, and then I would just feed it in. It's the same process, but it's a front end and a back end. So you have your front end, which is what most people are using now. We would just set up your account differently so it just goes into the back end. Same information, same algorithm. And so it would automatically do that. It could automatically send it to ChatGPT and then you just get delivered your analysis with your questions and everything that you do. And so you check in again—is this analysis work? Does this analysis look right? Does it look good? Okay. The things that we would have to build, the things that we would have to work on are how a lot of the details work. Okay, what if this happens? What if this doesn't happen? What if I get this document, but I don't get all of those little things? And I think that's why over time, you can be less and less in the process. But upfront, you would be in certain points of the process to be like, okay, it labeled these documents correctly. It was supposed to be a Grundbuch, nine times out of ten it is Grundbuch, but one time it was a PNL, it got mixed up. Those kind of things can happen. And so my question for you would be, are there places—let me just outline this so it's clear. Your documents come in from a source, from a client. The documents are analyzed, they're sorted, they're named, they're saved into a Google Docs—let's say it's easiest to use. Then the documents are taken from this drive or wherever they're saved, piped into your analysis, and then your analysis is run and then you get the analysis.
Sway Clarke
43:11
I mean, you could automate the process so the questions from the analysis are put into an email and then the email is sent out to the client. You could do this all automated, right? Technically, my question for you would be: are there places in this flow where you feel a little uncomfortable or want to do that yourself? That's just a question to think about, because it can be set up so you have checkpoints, just checking in on the system—okay, all the documents are cool, yes, keep going.
Sway Clarke
43:50
The analysis is cool, keep going. The follow-up questions are cool, keep going. You can put yourself in there as many times as you want. Obviously, it's more work, but it's just a good thing to consider. That would be my question, because when I'm designing it, I would love to understand: where would you want to put yourself in versus where you're comfortable letting the system handle it?
Sway Clarke
44:10
Where would you want to put yourself in versus where you're like, this can be automated?
Sway Clarke
44:18
It's not something we're going to have to have another call about, obviously. It's something to think about. Some people are just not comfortable with AI doing certain things, but are totally comfortable with it doing others. It just has to be a system that you're comfortable with.
Sway Clarke
44:32
Right now, for example, you have an agent

### Current Setup and Eugene's Reaction (44:39 - 52:03)

Sway Clarke
44:39
that
Sway Clarke
44:40
has your prompt that you created, your analysis prompt.
Sway Clarke
44:46
Is this analysis prompt already structured in a way that you could just give it to me, for example, and I could use it?
Sway Clarke
44:53
Just to make sure you've got that prompt.
Eugene
44:54
Yes.
Sway Clarke
44:57
You have another call at 12, so
Sway Clarke
44:59
what I wanted to do with this call was make sure that we're addressing the right problem, that you see the value in this approach. My next and last question would be:
Sway Clarke
45:20
Of what I talked about, do you see it working the same way? Or are there areas where you'd say, actually, I would do it differently? Just let me know if something doesn't work or doesn't make sense.
Eugene
45:32
This is a whole new perspective thinking about my work.
Eugene
45:47
In a good way.
Eugene
45:50
To give you straight feedback, that's why I was asking, like, are you serious right now? What's going on today?
Sway Clarke
45:57
Yeah.
Eugene
45:57
Did I get the words leaving your mouth, but am I connecting it directly?
Eugene
46:04
If this can be done—of course this can be done. This is my whole life. I was like, what is going on? Why is none of this tech working?
Eugene
46:16
One question I had—one checkpoint—would be the follow-up email, because this is crucial. If the client signs, there's a sense of, "Okay, this guy gets me," and then you can add something individual, like, "Hey, how's the dog doing?" or something like that.
Sway Clarke
46:34
For sure.
Eugene
46:34
Anything else to them, because they all kind of look alike, sound the same—these generic emails out there. For me, as soon as I see this long dash, I know, okay.
Eugene
46:51
All these posts out there.
Sway Clarke
46:52
This is generated, yeah.
Eugene
46:54
Yeah, I'm glad it's too long. You're like, got you.
Eugene
46:59
With that being said, Sway, this is crazy.
Eugene
47:04
I will do the forms.
Eugene
47:07
By the end of the day, I understand my part is you want something from me. So it's my rules you're going to play by, right? I'm not coming to sell you the newest iPhone and your old one still works. You come to me because you need money in order to be fast.
Eugene
47:25
To talk to my guys to give you the money, this is the way we're going to do it. It's not your way. If it was your way, we wouldn't talk in the first place. So I would even go so far to say with the formula, it makes total sense what you're saying.
Eugene
47:42
Everything that saves me time, as you were saying, makes sense, and this is huge.
Eugene
47:50
I can't really quantify it in time because it always depends, but this is a huge, huge pain.
Eugene
47:56
Pain in the ass.
Eugene
47:58
If you solve this problem, anything else I can do manually, but just get this off the table. If you remember, what would be the thing you'd give to your assistant? This is the thing. Email, give me the Grundbuch, tag the Grundbuch, give me the PNL, etc.
Eugene
48:19
If you have the knowledge, do the analysis, come to me, I will look over, we double check, and then off we go. So if you're talking about 100,
Eugene
48:29
It's like
Eugene
48:31
80% of the time is spent getting a really good analysis ready, and then saying, okay.
Sway Clarke
48:36
Okay.
Eugene
48:38
It's like 80% of the time is spent getting a really good analysis ready, and then saying, okay.
Eugene
48:48
Now let's go, before we even get to gamma and draft a memo or whatever. I know you have to go in nine minutes, but it totally makes sense. If I forget anything else, I'll WhatsApp or email you. I'm going to send you the prompt anyway. But right now, where we are, I'm like,
Eugene
49:06
this can be done.
Sway Clarke
49:07
Bro, I mean, look, we're going to build this together, so it's going to be some back and forth.
Sway Clarke
49:16
We're also working with the German language, so we have to make sure things are tight, that the system recognizes everything. There's going to be some testing, but it's doable. I want to have another call with you, because I'm also talking with a developer I work with.
Sway Clarke
49:50
Just to make sure technically things are sound. I use them as a sounding board—like, "Hey, I want to do these documents, what's the best process to analyze them?" Then let the developers know, "Actually, use this system, this is better than that." So I'm going to do that. I also want to give you an official proposal. I told you I would be doing this for
Sway Clarke
50:12
a testimonial, and I still adhere to that. There is value to this system—I know it will save you money, make you money, and there's value to it. But I want to make it official, sign a proposal. It's still going to be low cost or free, but I want to understand the value, have you understand the value, and then work out what I need from you, what you need from me, what our expectations are, and then move forward to build this thing out.
Sway Clarke
50:45
And the one thing I would say is...
Sway Clarke
50:51
Sometimes these kind of processes, when you break them out like this, they look like, okay, let's put this together, there's four steps. But then sometimes you're like these two steps are fucking difficult.
Sway Clarke
51:01
Like these two steps are so much more work than we thought, but these two steps will save you the most time, for example. So sometimes we may be like, okay, well maybe we don't, maybe we do all of the thing up until the—
Eugene
51:09
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
51:15
But now you have all the documents sorted, you have them all labeled, you have everything, and now you just got to go take those documents and put them into your agent for now, for example.
Eugene
51:27
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
51:28
But I want to build it in steps. I'm not going to build the whole thing and then say, does this work? We're going to build it first, like, okay, reading the emails. Let me see what an email looks like that you get with six documents. Okay, let's read it or let's put this into a form and let's see how the form works. If we put them into the form, where do you get them step by step.
Eugene
51:40
Mm-hmm.
Eugene
51:47
Mm-hmm.
Sway Clarke
51:48
The end of it we have this process. That's the goal.
Eugene
51:56
Sounds good.
Eugene
52:03
And dude, you don't need to explain it like that. I mean, I get the point and like going in and troubleshooting and I mean just before you even started, I mean fucking chachibit, I don't know how many fucking billions they raised and I mean and still I'm like dude are you serious like why is it still not like literally, then I get pissed off on my 20 euros a month, right? I'm like—
