# Eugene - First Discovery Call Transcript
**Date:** December 1, 2025
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Type:** Initial Discovery Call
**Status:** First contact - Problem identification phase

---

## Executive Summary

This first discovery call revealed Eugene's core business challenge: spending **5-10 hours per deal** on manual document qualification for real estate finance deals. Eugene has already adopted ChatGPT to reduce this from 1 week to 5 hours, but it's still too manual. He envisions a "Jarvis-like" automation system that can handle document identification, labeling, and verification automatically.

**Key Revelation:** 90-95% of Eugene's business is documents; only 5% is relationship-building and storytelling.

## Opening Discussion

**Sway:** So, Eugene, walk me through your typical deal flow. When a client comes to you with a project, what happens?

**Eugene:** Okay, so they usually email me or we meet in person. Most of the time it starts with email. They send me some information about the project - could be a teaser, could be just a few sentences about what they want to do.

**Sway:** And then what?

**Eugene:** Then I need to qualify the deal. Is it something I can help with? Do they have the right documents? Can I actually place this with a lender?

**Sway:** How long does that qualification take you?

**Eugene:** *[Pause]* That's the problem. Right now, even with ChatGPT... I'm talking about at least five to 10 hours.

**Sway:** Five to ten hours per deal.

**Eugene:** Per deal, just in this stage though.

**Sway:** Just in qualification?

**Eugene:** Yes. Before I was using ChatGPT, it was like a week. I'd spend a whole week just trying to figure out if I could work with someone.

**Sway:** And with ChatGPT?

**Eugene:** Now it's down to five hours, maybe ten depending on how messy their documents are. But it's still very manual.

## Deep Dive: The Document Challenge

**Sway:** Tell me more about these documents. What exactly are you dealing with?

**Eugene:** Okay, so in German real estate finance, there are certain documents that every deal needs. Things like the Grundbuch, the calculation, exit strategy, teaser... probably 18 different document types.

**Sway:** And clients send these to you?

**Eugene:** They're supposed to. But here's the thing - they never label them properly. I get an email with like 20 attachments, and they're all named something like "Document1.pdf" or "Final_FINAL_v3.pdf" *[laughs]*

**Sway:** So you have to open each one and figure out what it is?

**Eugene:** Exactly! I open it, look at it, think "okay this is the Grundbuch," then I have to rename it, move it to the right folder, make a note that I have it, check if it's complete...

**Sway:** That's incredibly manual.

**Eugene:** And that's if they send everything. Usually they're missing stuff, so then I have to go back and say "Hey, I still need the exit strategy, I still need the Wirtschaftsplan..." It's back and forth, back and forth.

## Current Workflow & Tools

**Sway:** What tools are you using now to manage all this?

**Eugene:** So I use Motion for my calendar and task management. PipeDrive is my CRM - that's where I track all the deals. I use Aircall for phone calls, Fireflies records the calls automatically. And then ChatGPT for a lot of the document analysis.

**Sway:** How are you using ChatGPT specifically?

**Eugene:** I'll take a document, upload it to ChatGPT, and ask it to summarize it or pull out specific information. Like "What's the loan amount?" or "What's the exit strategy?" It works, but I'm doing it one document at a time.

**Sway:** So you're manually uploading each document to ChatGPT?

**Eugene:** Yes, exactly. That's why it still takes five hours even with AI. I've just replaced opening the document and reading it myself with uploading it to ChatGPT. But it's still me doing it one by one.

## The Vision: "Jarvis for Deals"

**Eugene:** What I really want... *[pause]* You know Tony Stark's Jarvis?

**Sway:** *[laughs]* Of course.

**Eugene:** I want that for my deals. I want to be able to forward an email to my system, and it just handles everything. It opens all the attachments, figures out what each document is, labels it correctly, checks if anything is missing, and tells me "Hey Eugene, you have everything except the exit strategy."

**Sway:** Fully automated document processing.

**Eugene:** Yes! And not just processing - verification. I need it to tell me if the documents are actually good quality. Like, is this Grundbuch recent enough? Does this calculation make sense? Is the exit strategy realistic?

**Sway:** So you're looking for both identification and analysis.

**Eugene:** Exactly. Right now I'm the bottleneck. Every deal has to go through me personally because I have to verify everything. But 90-95% of what I do is just document work. The actual relationship-building and storytelling - that's maybe 5% of my time.

---

## Business Impact

**Sway:** How many deals are you working on at once?

**Eugene:** Right now I can handle about six per year, maybe eight if I push it. But that's because of this document bottleneck.

**Sway:** And if we automated this qualification stage?

**Eugene:** If I could get this down to like an hour or two per deal instead of five to ten hours? I could probably do fifteen deals a year. Maybe twenty.

**Sway:** That's a significant capacity increase.

**Eugene:** And it's not just capacity. I'd have more time to actually build relationships, to work on marketing, to improve my lender network. Right now I'm just drowning in documents.

## Deal Types & Document Variations

**Sway:** You mentioned there are different types of deals. Does that affect the documents you need?

**Eugene:** Yes, definitely. I have three main deal profiles:

1. **Acquisition finance** - someone buying a property to develop or flip
2. **Development finance** - someone building something new
3. **Refinance** - someone wants to refinance existing debt

**Sway:** Do they all need the same documents?

**Eugene:** There's a lot of overlap, but each type has some unique requirements. Like, development finance needs much more detailed plans and permits. Refinance needs the current loan documentation.

**Sway:** So your system would need to handle different document sets based on deal type?

**Eugene:** Yes, but I can define those. I know exactly what I need for each type. The problem isn't knowing what I need - it's getting it organized and verified.

---

## Client Communication Challenge

**Sway:** When you tell clients you're missing documents, how do they usually respond?

**Eugene:** *[laughs]* Usually they're like "Oh, I thought I sent that!" or "That's in there, it's just labeled differently." Sometimes they send me the same document three times with different names and I don't realize it's a duplicate.

**Sway:** So there's a communication breakdown.

**Eugene:** Absolutely. They don't understand what I need, and I'm spending all this time explaining it. If I had a system that could just tell them "You're missing these three specific documents" with examples... that would save so much back and forth.

---

## Data Room Concept Emerges

**Eugene:** Actually, you know what would be ideal? If clients could just upload their documents to a portal, and the system processes them in real-time.

**Sway:** Like a data room?

**Eugene:** Yes! Exactly like a data room. They upload everything, the system automatically categorizes it, tells them what's missing, maybe even shows them examples of what they need to provide.

**Sway:** That would shift the work from you to the system.

**Eugene:** And to the client, in a good way. They could see exactly what's needed, upload documents as they get them, track their own progress. Right now it's all on me to manage.

---

## Language & Document Complexity

**Sway:** These are all German documents, right?

**Eugene:** Yes, everything is in German. Some documents are in English if the client is international, but all the official German documents - Grundbuch, Baugenehmigung, all that - it's German.

**Sway:** Does ChatGPT handle German documents well?

**Eugene:** It's pretty good actually. German isn't the problem. The problem is more about understanding the document structure. A Grundbuch always has certain sections in a certain order, for example. An AI needs to understand that structure to know if it's complete and valid.

**Sway:** So it's document type recognition plus content validation.

**Eugene:** Exactly. Not just "this is a PDF with German text" but "this is a Grundbuch from 2024, and it's complete because it has all the required sections."

---

## Integration Needs

**Sway:** You mentioned PipeDrive as your CRM. Would you want this new system to integrate with that?

**Eugene:** That would be amazing. Right now I'm manually updating PipeDrive as I process documents. If the system could automatically update the deal status, add notes, upload the organized documents... that would save even more time.

**Sway:** What about the other tools - Motion, Aircall, Fireflies?

**Eugene:** Motion integration would be nice for scheduling follow-ups. Like if documents are missing, automatically schedule a reminder to follow up in three days.

**Sway:** Building a central hub that connects everything.

**Eugene:** Yes! Everything flows through the document processing, so that should be the center. Everything else connects to it.
