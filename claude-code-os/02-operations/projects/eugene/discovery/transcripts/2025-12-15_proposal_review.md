## Transcript

[00:00:00] **Sway Clarke:** What's up man?

[00:00:03] **Sway Clarke:** How you doing man?

[00:06:29] **Sway Clarke:** So what I wanted to do, I just wanted to, like, lay out the proposal.

[00:06:40] **Sway Clarke:** So I know we had a few conversations, but I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page. Everything's kind of clear, clear, clear, clear.

[00:12:21] **Sway Clarke:** Basically, I just wanted to go over a few things, basically go over the scope of the build and kind of what we're doing here. And so here, I mean, basically just some information about yourself, obviously, you know, but, you know, Debt Advisor processing currently six deals a year, approximately, and you want it to scale to 50. And, you know, we're kind of looking to reduce 80%.

[00:12:45] **Sway Clarke:** I kind of looking at, we'll jump around with this percentage, but 80% of the time on manual documentation processing between beginning with qualification phase.

[00:13:12] **Sway Clarke:** So here are the kind of the opportunities that I kind of pointed out. You have a document bottleneck, which is basically what we're talking about.

[00:13:43] **Sway Clarke:** And then you have this capacity ceiling, which is you're capped at six to seven or around that, and you really want to grow.

[00:13:53] **Sway Clarke:** The solutions I've kind of mapped out here - the solution is got to break this down into parts because it's a pretty big scope. I've broken it down into three phases.

## Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Document Detection & Sorting
[00:14:00] **Sway Clarke:** Phase one would just be that kind of detection, identification, rename, putting those things, and there's kind of like a phase 1.5, which is, you've identified to me that there's between two to four main documents that you need in order to go in.

[00:15:01] **Sway Clarke:** But at the end of the day, there's also 18 documents that at the end, I'm assuming you want to also be able to recognize, right? So my feeling is we focus basically on the first four in the priority phase, which is enough for the system going so that you can continue to go.

### Phase 2: Automated Reply System
[00:15:46] **Sway Clarke:** Phase two would be the automated reply system. So what that means is once we've noted all these four documents and we've got them all sorted, when we have a system that says, okay, we only got three of the documents, we build an automated reply system that says, hey, client, Max Musterman, we need another document for you, right?

### Phase 3: LLM Analysis
[00:17:30] **Sway Clarke:** Phase three, which is the final analysis, which is your ChatGPT LLM analysis, this is when we build out that part of the system. Once we've got all the replies, then we've got the third phase where it automatically goes into your ChatGPT system, and then you'll be able to extract all the information.

## Technical Details

[00:20:19] **Sway Clarke:** So basically, let's take the Grundbuch. I have to get a bunch of different Grundbuch. I want a minimum of five from you, for example. But the more, the better, because they might be different from different developers.

[00:20:37] **Sway Clarke:** And I have to train, I have to basically go into the, to like an LLM, which ChatGPT, or Claude, whichever one I decide to use, and train it to say, whenever you see this on this document, this means it's a Grundbuch.

[00:21:15] **Sway Clarke:** And then I have to make sure that this gets to a percentage base. I got to make sure that, like, whenever it recognizes something, it also labels it and says, I'm 97% sure that this is a Grundbuch.

[00:22:27] **Sway Clarke:** You want to go back and use like a 3.5, but the way to do that is really prompted. You got to set up the system properly. Got to train it. People that really know how to prompt get cheaper work out of a system.

## Timeline Discussion

[00:26:10] **Sway Clarke:** Development would be, you know, building this out, testing this out, training the model, which I would say about three weeks. One week would be deployment. Deployment would be putting it into your system.

## Investment & Value

[00:37:00] **Sway Clarke:** For this phase one, there's no charge for this. The investment is the time that you're going to have to spend giving feedback and testing. And I would ask that a video or a written testimonial after satisfaction of phase one.

[00:38:00] **Sway Clarke:** Time-based is my time, 250 euros a day to build. Over that time, it came up to roughly around 2,500.

[00:38:17] **Sway Clarke:** And then I did something of a value-based, which is your time balanced at like 200 per hour. If you were to save these hours, these amount of hours per year for six customers, it actually works out to 2,400 euros of your time saves value.

## Next Steps

[00:58:18] **Eugene Owusu:** This is great. Everything makes sense. I have the historical documents ready. Let's start development January 5th after the holidays.

[01:00:00] **Sway Clarke:** Perfect. I'll send over a simple agreement for Phase 1. Get me the 5-20 historical client files before the holidays so I can do initial research.
