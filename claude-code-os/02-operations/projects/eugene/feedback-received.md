## Discovery Phase Feedback

### December 1, 2025 - First Discovery Call

**Context:** Initial discovery to understand Eugene's business and pain points

---

**Pain Point Articulation:**

> "Before ChatGPT, it was like a week. I'd spend a whole week just trying to figure out if I could work with someone."

**Insight:** Eugene has already seen improvement with ChatGPT (1 week → 5-10 hours), but it's still too manual and time-consuming for growth.

---

> "They're supposed to [label documents]. But here's the thing - they never label them properly."

**Insight:** Clients don't follow instructions on labeling documents. System must handle unlabeled, poorly named files.

---

**Vision Statement:**

> "You know Tony Stark's Jarvis? I want that for my deals."

**Insight:** Eugene's vision is high-level AI assistance. Important to manage expectations - Phase 1 is automation, not AI analysis.

---

**Current State Frustration:**

> "90-95% of what I do is just document work. The actual relationship-building and storytelling - that's maybe 5% of my time."

**Insight:** Eugene is spending time on wrong activities. He wants to flip this ratio - more time on relationships, less on documents.

---

**Growth Potential:**

> "If I could get this down to like an hour or two per deal instead of five to ten hours? I could probably do fifteen deals a year. Maybe twenty."

**Insight:** Clear understanding of capacity constraints. Automation directly translates to revenue growth (€18K → €45-60K).

**Emotional State:** Hopeful but uncertain if solution is achievable

**Action:** Continue discovery to define specific solution

---

### December 9, 2025 - Second Discovery Call

**Context:** Solution specification and technical requirements gathering

---

**Refined Pain Point:**

> "I'm spending about 80% of my time just on document management."

**Insight:** More precise than Dec 1 estimate (90-95%). Still shows massive time sink on low-value work.

---

**The "Aha Moment":**

> **Sway:** "What if you just forward the email to a special address, and the system automatically does all of that for you?"

> **Eugene:** "Are you fucking kidding me? That's exactly what I need!"

**Insight:** This was the breakthrough moment. Eugene realized the solution is simpler than he thought - no complex portal, no client training, just email forwarding.

**Emotional State:** Extremely excited, enthusiastic

**Impact:** Confirmed Phase 1 approach is exactly what Eugene needs

---

**Simplicity Realization:**

> "I thought this was going to be some complex portal I had to learn..."

**Insight:** Eugene expected a complicated solution. Simple email forwarding exceeded expectations by being easier.

**Design Principle:** Keep Phase 1 workflow dead simple - no behavior change for Eugene

---

**Buying Signal:**

> "This is a no-brainer. What's the investment?"

**Insight:** Strong buying signal. Eugene immediately ready to discuss pricing and timeline.

**Emotional State:** Convinced, ready to move forward

**Next Step:** Prepare formal proposal with pricing (€15-25K, 8-12 weeks)

---

**Urgency:**

> "I've been dreaming about this for months."

**Insight:** This isn't a nice-to-have - Eugene has been actively wanting this solution. High urgency to proceed.

**Action:** Prioritize proposal and contract phase to maintain momentum

---

## Key Themes from Feedback

### Theme 1: Time Waste on Low-Value Work
- Eugene spends 80% of time on document management
- Only 5-20% on high-value relationships and deal-making
- Clear desire to flip this ratio

**Design Implication:** Automation must be thorough enough to eliminate 80% of document work, not just speed it up.

---

### Theme 2: Simplicity Over Sophistication
- Eugene expected complex "Jarvis-like" system
- Got excited about simple email forwarding
- "Are you fucking kidding me?" = relief at simplicity

**Design Implication:** Resist feature creep. Phase 1 should be as simple as possible.

---

### Theme 3: No Client Training Acceptable
- Clients don't label documents correctly today
- Eugene doesn't want to train clients to use a portal (Phase 1)
- Email forwarding requires zero client behavior change

**Design Implication:** Phase 1 backend only. Phase 2 can introduce client portal after validation.

---

### Theme 4: Growth Mindset
- Eugene sees clear path from 6 → 15-20 deals
- Revenue increase from €18K → €45-60K
- Willing to invest for growth

**Design Implication:** ROI messaging critical. System must deliver capacity increase, not just time savings.

---

## Sentiment Analysis

### December 1 Call
**Emotion:** Hopeful uncertainty
**Confidence Level:** Low-Medium
**Key Phrase:** "I want that for my deals" (aspirational, uncertain if achievable)

### December 9 Call
**Emotion:** Excited breakthrough
**Confidence Level:** Very High
**Key Phrase:** "Are you fucking kidding me?" (shocked at simplicity, immediately convinced)

**Sentiment Shift:** From "I hope someone can build this" to "When can we start?"

---

## Proposal Phase Feedback

### Expected Feedback Areas

**Pricing:**
- Eugene asked "What's the investment?" - ready to discuss
- Expect questions on ROI timeline (answer: 3-6 months)
- Expect questions on payment structure (milestone-based recommended)

**Timeline:**
- Eugene has urgency ("dreaming about this for months")
- 8-12 weeks likely acceptable if justified
- Monthly progress updates will be important

**Scope:**
- Eugene may suggest Phase 2 features for Phase 1 (scope creep risk)

- Emphasize faster ROI with focused Phase 1
