## Dependencies and Risks

### Critical Path Items
1. **Calendar link sent (A6)** → BLOCKS scheduling
2. **Availability shared (A1)** → BLOCKS call confirmation
3. **Admin team coordinated (A3)** → BLOCKS Ambushed discovery
4. **Partner coordinated (A4)** → BLOCKS Bold Move TV discovery
5. **Discovery calls completed** → BLOCKS proposal creation
6. **Proposals approved** → BLOCKS implementation start

### Risk Factors and Mitigation

**Risk:** Follow-up calls not scheduled quickly
- **Impact:** Lost momentum, delayed timeline
- **Mitigation:** Sway sends link within 24 hours, frequent check-ins
- **Contingency:** Async information gathering if scheduling difficult

**Risk:** Admin team unavailable or unwilling to participate
- **Impact:** Incomplete process understanding
- **Mitigation:** Sindbad coordination, clear value explanation to team
- **Contingency:** Multiple shorter calls instead of one comprehensive call

**Risk:** Sales strategy unclear (Bold Move TV)
- **Impact:** Wrong automation built
- **Mitigation:** Strategy clarification before automation design (A5)
- **Contingency:** Phased approach - start with lead tracking only

**Risk:** Budget constraints delay or limit implementation
- **Impact:** Partial solution or delayed start
- **Mitigation:** Flexible pricing options, phased delivery, clear ROI
- **Contingency:** Start with highest-ROI item (Ambushed) first

**Risk:** Partnership tension impacts decision-making (Ambushed)
- **Impact:** Approval delays, scope changes
- **Mitigation:** Keep Sindbad as primary stakeholder, document ROI clearly
- **Contingency:** Separate Bold Move TV work (fully independent)
