## Business Problems Identified

### Problem 1: Freelancer Payment Reconciliation (Ambushed)

**Time Investment:** 5-6 hours per week (~20 hours/month)

**Current Process:**
1. Admin team enters project hours and rates into Google Sheets dashboard
2. Dashboard has monthly tabs with all projects, freelancer hours, rates, turnover calculations
3. Sindbad manually reviews every invoice weekly (not bi-weekly or monthly - needed for cash flow)
4. Checks hours against dashboard, verifies rates, confirms project details
5. Manually makes 15-20 payments per week via Wise (international bank)
6. Payment window: 3-4 weeks from invoice date (promise to all freelancers)

**Why Weekly:** Cash flow management - doing it bi-weekly caused cash flow problems

**Tools Used:**
- Google Sheets (project dashboard)
- Wise (payment platform with batch payment capability)
- Google Docs (invoice templates)

**Quality Control Issues Sindbad Catches (~10% of time):**
- Projects not entered in dashboard (therefore not invoiced to clients)
- Rate discrepancies
- Excessive hours that don't match project scope
- Missing information

**Desired Outcome:**
- Maintain quality control (Sindbad wants second set of eyes, not trust to one person)
- Reduce time spent to near zero
- Keep human checkpoint before final payment
- Potentially identify admin team inefficiencies

**What Sindbad Would Do With Saved Time:**
- Business strategy work
- Screenplay writing
- Personal creative projects

### Problem 2: Lead Tracking & Reactivation (Bold Move TV)

**Current Situation:**
- Started building "Request Tracker" in Google Sheets
- Tracks lead status: waiting on client, ghosted, canceled, etc.
- Manual process to go through emails and identify leads
- No systematic follow-up process

**Use Cases:**
1. **Lead Reactivation:** Re-contact warm leads who showed interest but didn't convert
   - Hypothesis: Easier than cold calling
   - Want to understand drop-off points in conversations
   - Analyze what messaging works/doesn't work
2. **Outbound Lead Generation:** Generate new leads systematically
3. **Sales Process Optimization:**
   - Test different CTAs (currently using "10-minute call" approach)
   - Consider implementing Calendly or similar booking system
   - Analyze email patterns to improve conversion

**Current Sales Challenges:**
- Not good at selling (Ambushed is word-of-mouth, Bold Move TV requires active sales)
- Employee with sales responsibilities got only 1 meeting in 3 months
- Can't afford dedicated sales professional
- Considering newsletter but concerned about time investment and user experience

**Desired Outcome:**
- Automated email parsing to identify and categorize leads
- Data on conversation drop-off points
- Not necessarily automated email sending (concerned about being annoying)
- Tactical, thoughtful reactivation strategy

## New Business Idea: Family Legacy Interviews

**Concept:** Send professional cameramen to film high-quality interviews with aging family members

**Team:** Sindbad + filmmaker friend with international cameraman network

**Service Offering:**
- BBC-style interviews with professional lighting and sound
- Questions about life history, worldview, family stories
- Delivered as searchable video archive

**AI/Automation Opportunities:**
1. **Automated Editing:** Remove bathroom breaks, clean up unusable footage
2. **Transcription:** Full automated transcript of interview
3. **Searchable Archive:** Type keyword (e.g., "countryside house") → jump to that moment in video
4. **Cost Reduction:** Avoid expensive manual editing while maintaining usability

**Tools Mentioned:**
- Sway recommended **Descript** for text-based video editing
- Can edit video by editing transcript
- Auto-remove ums, ahs, filler words, silent gaps
- Potentially solves the automated editing challenge

## Key Quotes

### On Time Management
> "18 to 20 hours a month... If I didn't have to do these five hour, four to five hours every week, what else would you be doing? Oh, wow.

### On Partnership Challenges
> "That's just between me and you. The sad thing about Ambush is, my business partner and I, like, really, we were very good at the beginning. And now, it's just, I don't, I don't think we have the same vision... I would almost prefer that he did like the bare minimum." - Sindbad
