- "I wouldn't want to do a batch payment before I've checked everything"
- Worried automation might be "annoying" to prospects
- Unclear if Bold Move TV needs strategy help vs automation

**Breakthrough Moment:**
> Sway: "It doesn't have to be an all or nothing. It doesn't have to be a Sindbad is in the process, or he's not in the process at all, and it's automated, right? You can always add in like a human checkpoint."

**Result:** Shifted from fear of automation to excitement about human-in-the-loop design

**Trust Indicators:**
- Agreed to include admin team (transparency)

- Acknowledged uncertainty about sales strategy (honest self-assessment)

**Next Trust-Building Steps:**

- Proposals address real pain points, not imagined ones

### Future Milestones - From Pilot to Partnership

## Key Decision Points

### Decision 1: Which Project First?
**Timeline:** Late January 2026 (after follow-up calls)
**Options:**
1. **Ambushed first** (recommended) - clear ROI, unlocks time for Bold Move TV
2. **Bold Move TV first** - lower complexity, faster win, but smaller impact
3. **Parallel development** - higher cost, faster overall delivery, resource intensive

**Recommendation:** Ambushed first
**Rationale:**
- €21K-27K annual value vs unknown ROI (Bold Move TV)
- Time savings directly enable Bold Move TV sales focus
- Admin team buy-in creates foundation for future automations
- Budget available (Ambushed pays the bills)

### Decision 2: How Much Automation?
**Timeline:** During proposal phase
**Options:**
1. **Validation only** - AI flags errors, Sindbad reviews, manual payments
2. **Validation + payment prep** - AI prepares Wise batch, Sindbad approves and executes
3. **Full automation** - AI validates, prepares, and executes payments (Sindbad audit trail)

**Recommendation:** Start with #2, scale to #3
**Rationale:**
- Build trust incrementally
- Maintain human checkpoint during pilot
- Reduce risk of payment errors
- Gradual adoption path

### Decision 3: CRM for Bold Move TV?
**Timeline:** During Bold Move TV strategy call
**Options:**
1. **Upgrade Google Sheets** - familiar, low cost, limited features
2. **HubSpot Free** - robust, CRM designed, learning curve
3. **Pipedrive** - sales-focused, similar to Ambushed (if Eugene connection), paid
4. **Notion** - flexible, visual, multi-purpose

**Recommendation:** Pending partner preferences and budget
**Rationale:**
- Partner must use it daily (adoption critical)
- Budget constraints (Bold Move TV not yet profitable)
- Integration complexity varies by tool
- Don't over-engineer for current scale

## Risk Register

### High Priority Risks

**R1: Calendar link not sent → project stalls**

- **Probability:** Low (Sway committed)
- **Mitigation:** Send link within 24 hours of this analysis

**R2: Admin team fears job loss → resistance**
- **Impact:** High (implementation failure)
- **Probability:** Medium

**R3: Bold Move TV sales strategy unclear → wrong automation built**
- **Impact:** High (wasted development, no ROI)
- **Probability:** Medium (Sindbad acknowledged uncertainty)
- **Mitigation:** Strategy call with partner first; don't automate until strategy is clear

### Medium Priority Risks

**R4: Partnership tension at Ambushed → political complications**
- **Impact:** Medium (automation might expose partner issues)
- **Probability:** Medium (already diverging visions)
- **Mitigation:** Keep automation focused on Sindbad's workflow, not partner evaluation

**R5: No baseline metrics for Bold Move TV → unprovable ROI**
