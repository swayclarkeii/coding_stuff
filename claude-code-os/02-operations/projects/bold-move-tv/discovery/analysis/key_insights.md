# Bold Move TV - Key Insights

## One-Liner
**Sindbad spends 20 hours/month manually validating freelancer invoices at Ambushed (90% revenue, 10% effort) instead of building sales for Bold Move TV (10% revenue, 90% passion).**

---

## Critical Pain Points

### Pain Point 1: Invoice Reconciliation Bottleneck (Ambushed)

**What happens today:**
1. Admin team enters project data into Google Sheets dashboard (monthly tabs)
2. Freelancers submit invoices weekly (15-20 per week)
3. Sindbad manually reviews every invoice against dashboard
4. Checks hours, rates, project details, turnover calculations
5. Makes 15-20 payments per week via Wise
6. Catches errors ~10% of the time (missing projects, rate discrepancies, excessive hours)

**Time cost:** 5-6 hours per week (20-24 hours/month)
**Percentage of Sindbad's time:** Dominates his week
**What it prevents:** Business strategy, screenplay writing, Bold Move TV growth

**Why it can't be eliminated:**
- Quality control is critical (10% error rate)
- Admin team needs oversight
- Cash flow requires weekly cadence (tried bi-weekly, caused problems)
- Sindbad wants "second set of eyes" not blind trust

### Pain Point 2: Lead Generation System (Bold Move TV)

**What happens today:**
1. Leads contact Bold Move TV via email
2. Sindbad manually identifies leads in inbox
3. Manually enters into "Request Tracker" Google Sheet
4. No systematic follow-up process
5. No conversion rate data
6. No reactivation strategy for warm leads

**Time cost:** Unknown (manual, ad-hoc, inefficient)
**Current performance:** 1 meeting in 3 months for sales employee
**What it prevents:** Revenue growth, scaling beyond Sindbad's network

**The deeper problem:**
- Not clear if it's a sales strategy problem or sales execution problem
- Employee "pretty crap at selling" (Sindbad's words)
- Can't afford dedicated sales professional
- No data on what works/doesn't work
- Worried automation might be "annoying" to prospects

## The "Aha Moment"

### Human-in-the-Loop as Trust-Building Architecture

**Initial Fear:**
> "I wouldn't want to do a batch payment before I've checked everything."

**Sway's Reframe:**
> "It doesn't have to be an all or nothing. It doesn't have to be a Sindbad is in the process, or he's not in the process at all, and it's automated, right? You can always add in like a human checkpoint."

**Sindbad's Response:**
> "I would be interested in not only speeding up my process, but also theirs [admin team]."

### Why This Clicked

**What Sindbad thought automation meant:**
- Remove human from process entirely
- Blind trust in system
- No quality control
- Risk of payment errors

**What Sindbad actually needs:**
- Automated data validation
- Exception flagging
- Human approval checkpoint
- 80-90% time reduction, not 100%

**The key insight:** Automation isn't about removing Sindbad - it's about upgrading him from data entry clerk to exception handler. He only reviews the 10% that needs human judgment.

## Critical Discovery Process Decisions

### D2: Include Admin Team in Ambushed Call

**What changed:**
- From: "Sindbad describes his process"
- To: "Admin team describes their process"

**Impact:**
- Shifted from personal efficiency to team efficiency
- Revealed potential upstream inefficiencies
- Built buy-in from implementation team
- Prevented building wrong solution

### D3: Separate Call for Bold Move TV Strategy

**What changed:**
- From: "Build lead generation automation"
- To: "First clarify sales strategy, then automate"

**Why it matters:**
- Sindbad acknowledged uncertainty: "whether I need help with my sales strategy or automation"
- Can't automate a broken sales process
- Need partner buy-in (different business, different stakeholders)

**Impact:**
- Prevented premature solution design
- Ensured automation serves clear strategy
- Involved right stakeholders from start

## Business Context & Competitive Dynamics

### Partnership Tension (Ambushed)

**The strategic opportunity:** Time saved at Ambushed → invested in Bold Move TV growth

## Key Quotes for Proposals

### On Time Value
> "18 to 20 hours a month... If I didn't have to do these five hour, four to five hours every week, what else would you be doing? Oh, wow. You know, I don't know, like, thinking about the strategy of the business, or working on my screenplay, you know, I might be doing my personal stuff."
