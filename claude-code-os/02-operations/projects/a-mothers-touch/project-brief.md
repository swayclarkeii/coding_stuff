# Project Brief - A Mother's Touch

## Client Information
- **Client Name:** Nicole Clarke
- **Business:** A Mother's Touch
- **Industry:** Catering, Custom Cakes, Meal Prep
- **Business Type:** Solo entrepreneur
- **Location:** New Jersey (inferred from transcript context)
- **Contact:** [TBD - from future communication]

---

## Project Overview

### Project Type
Discovery → Potential automation implementation project

### Core Objective
Design and implement administrative automation systems to reduce manual workload, improve lead qualification, and streamline quote generation for a solo catering/cake business.

### Project Status
🟡 **Discovery Phase** - Pending proposal

---

## Business Context

### Current Operation
Nicole operates A Mother's Touch as a solo entrepreneur, handling both the physical kitchen work (food prep, baking, cooking) and all administrative tasks. The business offers:
- Custom cakes (wedding cakes, celebration cakes, etc.)
- Catering services
- Meal prep services
- Private chef services

### Business Model
- **Customer Acquisition:** 70% social media (Instagram/Facebook), 30% email/Google
- **Quoting Process:** Link Tree → Service-specific forms → Dubsado → Manual invoice
- **Service Delivery:** Commercial kitchen + client locations
- **Pricing:** Custom quotes based on detailed requirements

### Team Structure
- **Current:** Nicole only (no assistants)
- **Desired:** Virtual admin assistance (human or automated)
- **Not in scope:** Physical kitchen assistance

---

## Problem Statement

Nicole spends 15-30 minutes per quote on manual administrative tasks, loses potential customers due to form completion friction, misses inquiries caught in social media spam folders, and wastes time on unqualified leads. The business needs automation to handle repetitive admin work while maintaining service quality and allowing Nicole to focus on her craft.

**Critical Pain Points:**
1. Manual quote generation (15-30 min per quote)
2. Late-stage lead qualification (wasted time on unaffordable projects)
3. Form completion friction (customer abandonment)
4. Multi-channel inquiry chaos (DMs, email, messages)
5. Vague customer inquiries requiring multiple follow-ups
6. Dubsado limitations (no auto-population of key fields)

---

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Reduce quote generation time** from 15-30 minutes to under 5 minutes
2. **Qualify leads earlier** to avoid time waste on unaffordable projects
3. **Increase form completion rate** to capture more serious buyers
4. **Unify multi-channel communications** into manageable system
5. **Automate repetitive tasks** (T&C attachment, field population, etc.)

### Success Metrics (To Be Defined)
- Time saved per quote (target: 66-80% reduction)
- Lead qualification accuracy (target: 80%+ filtering before quote stage)
- Form completion rate improvement (need baseline)
- Reduction in missed/spam folder inquiries
- Customer satisfaction maintenance or improvement

### Stretch Goals
- Integration with external vendor systems
- Advanced analytics on inquiry sources and conversion
- Predictive pricing based on historical data
- Automated follow-up sequencing

---

## Scope Considerations

### In Scope (Potential)
- Quote generation automation
- Lead qualification system
- Form optimization
- Multi-channel inquiry management
- Dubsado workflow enhancement
- Social media auto-response setup
- Email automation

### Out of Scope
- Physical kitchen assistance
- Hands-on food preparation help
- Inventory management (physical)
- Grocery shopping assistance

### To Be Determined
- Level of AI vs. rule-based automation
- Integration depth with existing tools
- Mobile app requirements
- Customer-facing portal needs
- Ongoing maintenance model

---

## Technical Landscape

### Current Tech Stack
- **Dubsado:** Client management, invoicing, form processing
- **Link Tree:** Form distribution
- **ChatGPT:** Ad-hoc email generation
- **Instagram/Facebook:** Primary customer acquisition
- **Email:** Secondary inquiry channel
- **Order Forms:** Service-specific (custom cakes, catering, meal prep, wedding cakes, etc.)

### Known Limitations
- Dubsado doesn't auto-populate key fields (event dates, locations, T&C)
- No unified inbox for multi-channel inquiries
- Social media spam filtering misses legitimate inquiries
- Forms are separate for each service (no dynamic forms)
- No automated quote generation from form data

### Integration Opportunities
- Dubsado API exploration
- Social media DM automation tools
- Form builder alternatives or enhancements
- Multi-channel inbox solutions
- AI-powered quote generation

## Key Stakeholders

### Primary
- **Nicole Clarke** - Business Owner, Decision Maker, End User

### Secondary
- **Customers** - End experience impacted by automation
- **External Vendors** - Integration points (e.g., cake topper supplier)

## Budget & Timeline

### Budget
- **Status:** Not yet discussed
- **Considerations:** Solo entrepreneur, needs strong ROI
- **Approach:** Likely phased implementation based on ROI priority

### Timeline
- **Discovery Call:** November 19, 2024
- **Proposal:** TBD
- **Implementation:** TBD (suggest phased approach)
- **Initial Quick Win Target:** Within 2-4 weeks of project start

---

## Risks & Challenges

### Business Risks
- **Operational continuity:** Can't pause business for implementation
- **Customer experience:** Automation must not degrade service quality
- **Solo operator capacity:** Limited time for testing and training
- **ROI pressure:** Investment must pay back quickly

### Technical Risks
- **Platform limitations:** Dubsado may not support desired automation
- **Social media restrictions:** Platform API limitations on DM automation
- **Integration complexity:** Multiple systems to connect
- **Data migration:** Historical data handling

### Customer Adoption Risks
- **Form resistance:** Customers already avoid structured forms
- **Communication preferences:** Customers prefer informal channels
- **Change management:** Shifting customer expectations gradually
