## Active Decisions

### Decision 1: Focus on Administrative Automation (Not Physical Assistance)
**Date:** 2024-11-19
**Meeting:** Discovery Call
**Decision Maker:** Nicole Clarke & Sway Clarke (mutual agreement)

**What:**
Project will focus exclusively on administrative automation (quotes, communications, lead qualification) rather than physical kitchen assistance.

**Why:**
- Consultant expertise is in automation/systems, not food service staffing
- Administrative pain points are more immediate and measurable
- ROI is clearer and faster for automation vs. hiring physical help
- Nicole has two separate needs but prioritized admin relief
- Automation can scale; physical help cannot without hiring

**Impact:**
- Defines project scope boundaries
- Eliminates physical kitchen tasks from consideration
- Focuses discovery on workflow automation opportunities
- Positions solution as technology-driven rather than staffing-driven

**Context:**
Nicole initially mentioned needing either physical kitchen help OR admin help. Through discussion, determined that admin automation addresses the most painful and solvable problems within consultant's expertise.

## Pending Decisions

### Pending Decision 1: Implementation Approach (Phased vs. All-at-Once)
**Status:** Awaiting proposal and client discussion
**Context:** Need to determine if quick wins should be implemented first or comprehensive solution deployed together
**Timeline:** To be decided during proposal presentation
**Dependencies:** Budget, timeline, risk tolerance

### Pending Decision 2: Platform Strategy (Enhance Dubsado vs. Replace)
**Status:** Requires technical discovery
**Context:** Unclear if Dubsado can be enhanced to meet needs or if alternative platform needed
**Timeline:** To be assessed during technical review
**Dependencies:** Dubsado API capabilities, integration costs, migration effort

### Pending Decision 3: Form Strategy (Optimize Current vs. Replace)
**Status:** Needs form completion data analysis
**Context:** Customer resistance to forms suggests possible need for alternative approach
**Timeline:** To be decided based on data
**Dependencies:** Completion rate baseline, alternative tools assessment

### Pending Decision 4: Level of AI Automation
**Status:** Awaiting technical feasibility and budget discussion
**Context:** Nicole already uses ChatGPT; opportunity for deeper AI integration
**Timeline:** To be defined in proposal
**Dependencies:** Budget, technical capability, quality assurance requirements

## Decision-Making Framework

### For This Project
**Decision Authority:**
- **Nicole (Client):** Final decision on all scope, budget, timeline, customer-facing changes
- **Sway (Consultant):** Recommendation authority on technical approach, tools, implementation strategy
- **Joint:** Risk assessment, success metrics, go-live criteria

**Decision Criteria:**
1. **ROI:** Time saved vs. investment required
2. **Risk:** Impact on ongoing business operations
3. **Complexity:** Implementation effort and learning curve
4. **Scalability:** Ability to grow with business
5. **Customer Impact:** Effect on customer experience

**Escalation Process:**
- Technical questions → Consultant recommendation → Client approval
- Scope changes → Joint discussion → Client final decision
- Budget impacts → Immediate client consultation
- Timeline conflicts → Joint problem-solving

## Notes & Observations

**Decision-Making Style Observed:**
- Nicole is methodical and detail-oriented
- Wants to understand the "why" behind recommendations
- Data-driven mindset (asks about metrics, volume, time)
- Risk-aware (concerned about customer impact, system reliability)
- Already experimenting (ChatGPT usage shows openness to new tools)

**Recommendation for Consultant:**
- Present decisions with clear data/evidence
- Offer multiple options with pros/cons
- Show examples from similar implementations
- Address risk mitigation explicitly
- Provide phased approach options
