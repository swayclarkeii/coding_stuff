## Timeline Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Client Data Not Available
**Impact:** Could delay proposal by 2-3 days
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Proceed with industry benchmarks and estimates if needed
**Status:** Monitoring

### Risk: Dubsado Platform Limitations
**Impact:** Could require alternative platform, adding 1-2 weeks
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Research alternatives in parallel, provide options
**Status:** Will assess by 2024-12-15

### Risk: Holiday Schedule Conflicts
**Impact:** Delays in scheduling meetings or reviews
**Probability:** High (December timeline)
**Mitigation:** Set clear deadlines, buffer time for holidays
**Status:** Factored into estimates

### Risk: Scope Expansion During Proposal
**Impact:** Could delay proposal completion
**Probability:** Low (discovery was comprehensive)
**Mitigation:** Phased approach allows for future expansion
**Status:** Low concern

## Dependencies & Critical Path

### Critical Path to Proposal Delivery

```
Week 1 (Dec 10-15):
Technical Research (parallel) → Quick Win Identification

Week 2 (Dec 16-20):
Design Work (parallel) → Integration Architecture → Estimates → Proposal

Week 2 (Dec 16-18):
Client Data Collection (parallel, can lag slightly)

Week 2 (Dec 20):
Proposal Delivery
```

**Critical Dependencies:**
1. Dubsado analysis must complete before architecture design
2. Tool research must complete before integration architecture
3. Architecture must complete before cost estimates
4. All research must complete before proposal finalization

**Non-Critical Dependencies:**
- Client data nice-to-have but not blocking (can use estimates)
- Form research can complete after proposal if needed
- Vendor documentation can wait for Phase 1

---

## Seasonal Considerations

### December Timeline Challenges
- Holiday schedules may impact availability
- Nicole's business may be busy with holiday orders
- Consultant availability around holidays
- Client decision-making may slow during holidays

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Deliver proposal before December 20
- Allow flexibility for review timing
- Plan Phase 1 kickoff for January if needed
- Set realistic expectations about holiday impacts

### Nicole's Business Seasonality
**Note from Discovery:** Quote volume varies significantly
- Peak seasons: TBD (need historical data)
- Slow seasons: TBD
- Implementation timing should consider busy seasons

**Recommendation:** Discuss optimal implementation timing during proposal

---

## Timeline Assumptions

1. **Consultant Capacity:** Sway has capacity for research and proposal development in December
2. **Client Responsiveness:** Nicole can provide requested data within 1 week
3. **Technical Feasibility:** Proposed solutions are technically achievable
4. **Decision Timeframe:** Nicole can review proposal and decide within 1-2 weeks
5. **Holiday Impact:** Some delays expected, factored into estimates
6. **Phased Approach:** Allows for flexibility if timeline pressure increases
