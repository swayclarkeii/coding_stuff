# Meeting Notes - A Mother's Touch Discovery Call
**Date:** 2024-11-19
**Type:** Discovery Call
**Client:** Nicole Clarke
**Company:** A Mother's Touch (Catering/Cake Business)
**Attendees:** Nicole Clarke (Business Owner), Sway Clarke (Consultant)

---

## Executive Summary

Nicole Clarke runs A Mother's Touch, a catering and custom cake business operating as a solo entrepreneur. She's seeking administrative automation to alleviate daily frustrations. Primary pain points include: manual quote generation through Dubsado (15-30 minutes per quote), managing customer inquiries across multiple channels (70% social media DMs, 30% email), difficulty qualifying leads before investing time, and losing potential customers due to form completion friction. She's already using ChatGPT for email generation, indicating readiness for automation solutions.

## Business Context

### Current Operation
- **Business Type:** Catering, custom cakes, meal prep, wedding cakes
- **Team Size:** Solo operator (no assistants)
- **Main Challenges:** Administrative overhead + physical kitchen work
- **Client Acquisition:** 70% social media (Instagram/Facebook DMs), 30% email/Google

### Current Tools
- **Dubsado:** Invoice/quote generation, client management
- **Link Tree:** Houses multiple order forms for different services
- **ChatGPT:** Email response generation
- **Order Forms:** Separate forms for each service (cakes, catering, meal prep, etc.)

---

## Key Pain Points Identified

### 1. Quote Generation Process (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Manual, time-consuming quote creation
- Takes 15 minutes when form is complete
- Takes 30+ minutes for email inquiries (requires creating client profile from scratch)
- Must manually input all product details, quantities, taxes, pricing
- Must copy/paste terms & conditions every time
- Must manually update event dates, times, addresses for each quote
- External vendor quotes add additional delays (e.g., acrylic cake toppers)

**Current Flow:**
1. Customer fills form → Email notification → Dubsado dashboard
2. Manual review of form responses
3. Manual invoice creation (only auto-fills client contact info)
4. Manual input of: products, quantities, taxes, delivery details, T&C
5. Manual send (not automated)

### 2. Lead Qualification (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Time wasted on unqualified leads
- Budget questions come too late in process
- Example: Customer wants 4-tier vegan cake with sugar flowers ($500 budget)
- Example: Customer wants simple red velvet cake ($70 budget) - after 10-minute call
- Cannot determine if lead is viable until after form completion or extended conversation

**Impact:**
- Time spent on quotes that go nowhere
- Calls/conversations with customers who can't afford services
- Frustration on both sides

### 3. Form Completion Friction (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Losing customers who won't complete forms
- Nicole suspects significant customer loss at form stage
- Customers want immediate prices via DM
- "Form's not working" complaints = missing required fields
- Customers prefer texting/DMing over structured forms

**Quote from Nicole:**
> "A lot of people are doing orders via text message and just send me a DM to order. That's insane. Like, it's crazy."

### 4. Multi-Channel Communication Chaos (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Managing inquiries across fragmented channels
- Instagram DMs
- Facebook messages (main inbox + spam/request folder)
- Email
- Direct phone calls
- Each channel has different customer expectations

**Specific Issues:**
- Social media inquiries are vague, fishing for prices
- Messages get caught in spam folders (Instagram & Facebook)
- Missed opportunities sitting in message request sections
- Example: Found Maine inquiry from May that was never seen

**Quote from Nicole:**
> "I find I've missed out on business. By the time I go back, like I went yesterday, there was one from Maine that was sitting in my Facebook message request section, never saw it."

### 5. Incomplete Information from Customers (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Customers provide vague requirements
- "I want a three-tier wedding cake with vanilla and flowers. How much?"
- Missing: servings, delivery location, date, design details, budget
- Requires multiple back-and-forth exchanges
- Extended phone calls for clarification

**Example Quote:**
> "She wants someone to come to her house and cook three, four times a week. She wants a price. I can't give you a price. Do you want meal prep? Do you want private chef services? What type of meals do you want?"

### 6. Social Media "Fishing" Behavior (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Customers shopping around for discounts
- Messaging multiple bakers simultaneously
- Not serious about ordering
- Looking for lowest price
- "Are you available? How much for this cake?"

**Impact:**
- Time spent on non-serious inquiries
- Difficulty distinguishing serious buyers from shoppers
- Inbox clutter

### 7. Dubsado Limitations (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem:** System doesn't automate what Nicole needs
- Can't auto-attach terms & conditions
- Can't auto-populate event-specific details from form
- Can't create invoice templates with pre-filled service descriptions
- Form data doesn't flow into invoice fields
- No automatic form-to-invoice generation

**What Works in Dubsado:**
- Live invoice updates (no need to regenerate)
- Client profile creation from forms
- Auto-fills business contact information
- Stores past client profiles for repeat customers

---

## Current Workarounds

### 1. ChatGPT for Email Generation
- Copies/pastes customer emails into ChatGPT
- Provides context on her position
- Gets generated response
- Saves mental energy

### 2. Canned Response for Social Media
**Auto-response text:**
> "Hey, thank you for inquiring. All of our order inquiries must go through the order form. Once you complete everything and receive it, we'll follow back up with you."

Includes: phone number, email, contact info

### 3. Manual Lead Qualification via Phone
- Calls customers when form shows budget mismatch
- "Is your budget flexible?"
- Discusses modification options to fit budget
- Determines viability before sending formal quote

---

## Topics Discussed

### 1. Administrative vs. Physical Assistance Needs
- Considered: physical kitchen help OR admin help
- Decision: Focus on admin automation (consultant's expertise)
- Physical help would handle: grocery shopping, inventory, grunt work

### 2. Quote Generation Workflow
- Detailed walkthrough of Dubsado process
- Form submission → email → dashboard → manual invoice creation
- Discussion of time requirements (15-30 minutes per quote)
- External vendor coordination (adding time complexity)

### 3. Communication Channel Management
- 70/30 split: Social media vs. Email
- Social media = more vague, fishing inquiries
- Email = more serious but still often incomplete
- Phone calls = unexpected, unqualified

### 4. Form Strategy & Customer Behavior
- Link Tree structure with service-specific forms
- Form completion friction causing customer loss
- Customer preference for informal communication
- Required fields causing "form not working" complaints

### 5. Lead Qualification & Budget Discovery
- Budget questions embedded in forms
- Problem: customers abandon before reaching budget question
- Need to qualify earlier in the process
- Missing opportunity to filter before time investment

### 6. Information Completeness Issues
- Brides don't know what they want
- Customers expect Nicole to provide all information via DM
- Resistance to "doing the work" of filling out forms

**Quote from Nicole:**
> "The problem was they are very vague in what they're asking for, especially with brides, because they don't know what they're doing."

### 7. Social Media Spam/Missed Messages
- Instagram & Facebook filter unknown contacts to spam
- Nicole checks sporadically
- Potential business sitting unseen for months
- No system to catch these automatically

### 8. Existing Tech Stack & Tools
- Dubsado (since 2022) - "better than before but still manual"
- Link Tree for form distribution
- ChatGPT for ad-hoc email generation
- Instagram & Facebook for client acquisition
- Google presence (drives email inquiries)

## Key Quotes

They don't want to take the few minutes to actually answer the questions so that I can give them a proper quote, which then in turn, if they don't get the proper quote, I give them a random price or a general price and then we have to go back and say oh well now you want this it's going to be this now you want this is going to be this." - Nicole Clarke on form friction

> "I need something that can streamline how they get the information that they need and I get the answers that I need to give them a quote so they can decide." - Nicole Clarke on core need
