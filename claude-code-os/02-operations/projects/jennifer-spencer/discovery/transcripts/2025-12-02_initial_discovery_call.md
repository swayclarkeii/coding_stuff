**Unknown speaker 00:01**
No.

**Unknown speaker 00:04**
Can you hear us?

**Unknown speaker 00:11**
Wait one sec. Let me try and leave and come

**Sway Clarke 00:13**
The volume. Turn up the volume.

**Jennifer Spencer 00:16**
Trying. It's not working. I can read your mind, buddy. Fuck off. Okay, let me just leave it.

**Sway Clarke 00:22**
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

**Steve 00:27**
You guys are like a married couple, it's hilarious.

**Steve 00:33**
Are you like, is it together or what is it right now?

**Sway Clarke 00:39**
Together.

**Steve 00:40**
Okay, I wasn't sure. Over time it's been like...

**Sway Clarke 00:45**
Not married but yeah, no, we're having—she just came up with three weeks ketamine therapy. It's pretty crazy. She's seeing—it's cool, it's really cool.

**Steve 00:52**
Three weeks of ketamine therapy with her therapist.

**Steve 00:57**
Yeah, three weeks in a row, like in the city.

**Sway Clarke 00:59**
Yeah, where they put her under and she goes in pretty deep and then the day after she's with her therapist and working through what comes up.

**Steve Fernandez 01:09**
It's kicked off—she's in weekly therapy now, but I've seen some really big jumps with her.

**Steve 01:17**
And is this something to do with business or this is just personally for her?

**Steve Fernandez 01:25**
Yeah, it's personal therapy. I got to give her credit because this is the most intense kind of therapy you can do where it's psychedelic-assisted.

**Steve 01:35**
Mm-hmm.

**Steve Fernandez 01:37**
And so when someone takes that jump.

**Steve Fernandez 01:40**
Free willingly to do it.

**Steve Fernandez 01:43**
That to me is like I'm putting the gauntlet down and going.

**Steve 01:47**
Commitment, yeah.

**Steve Fernandez 01:48**
Like I'm going to look for it. Yeah. And it's cool. You have a lot of credit.

**Steve 01:51**
I didn't know that was legalized there. Since when? It's pretty new.

**Steve Fernandez 01:59**
New, like within a year.

**Steve Fernandez 02:03**
This is all done with doctors and under supervision. It's expensive. It's like 700 bucks a round.

**Steve 02:12**
Like a day?

**Steve 02:16**
Bro.

**Sway Clarke 02:18**
Yeah.

**Steve Fernandez 02:20**
This isn't—it hits you in the pocketbook too.

**Steve Fernandez 02:28**
I mean, when I did it, it was like—we're not talking about it, right? I could lose my license if I did it, but now

**Steve Fernandez 02:37**
It's being sanctioned. When I did it, it was seven years ago.

**Steve 02:43**
And it was the same cost?

**Steve Fernandez 02:43**
So things have changed.

**Steve 02:46**
No, because now that it's legalized, it's like—

**Steve Fernandez 02:48**
It was just like a shot went up from Mexico and, you know, pay a hundred bucks and you went out and did your journey, right?

**Steve 02:56**
For you, ketamine—this is equivalent to that. They would say ketamine is equivalent to that.

**Steve Fernandez 02:58**
I did it differently.

**Sway Clarke 03:02**
Stop it there.

**Steve Fernandez 03:04**
It's a different experience.

**Steve Fernandez 03:10**
A different drug, different experience.

**Steve Fernandez 03:13**
But equivalent in—

**Steve Fernandez 03:20**
The risk of food.

**Steve Fernandez 03:23**
Equivalent in the risk profile.

**Steve 03:25**
Okay.

**Steve Fernandez 03:25**
I was telling Sway about your ketamine journeys and how proud I am of you. He was asking me about what changed.

**Jennifer Spencer 03:33**
A late intro into hi, how are you? Good to see you.

**Steve 03:35**
I'm telling about your family journeys.

**Jennifer Spencer 03:38**
I was doing drugs and now I'm cured.

**Steve 03:40**
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

**Jennifer Spencer 03:43**
What were you saying, Steve?

**Steve 03:43**
No, I was just curious about it.

**Steve Fernandez 03:46**
I was saying that things have changed in the seven or eight years I've done it with a therapist and that's legalized now.

**Steve Fernandez 04:00**
There's a protocol for it and it's expensive. It was like 700 bucks a week. Also, it's not being talked about, so what's interesting is Jen's in a place where she can speak to this.

**Steve Fernandez 04:12**
Not have to keep it under wraps like, "Oh, I did this thing on the low," and you're at the front of this therapy in a way that you can talk to it and be very informed about it.

**Steve Fernandez 04:24**
You've got language to speak about it and you've got a following to speak to about it, so Jen's in a very interesting place when I think about talking into psychiatric-assisted therapy.

**Steve Fernandez 04:39**
Interesting place.

**Jennifer Spencer 04:42**
Yeah, it literally changed my life. I don't even—

**Steve 04:47**
Amen.

**Jennifer Spencer 04:48**
It's pretty amazing when—it's almost like you can see the patterns of what you keep circling around in, but then you don't know how to get out of the loop. I'm trying rationally to make a change and do something different and you just don't know how to break the cycle. But when you do these psychedelics, whether it's ketamine or mushrooms or whatever it is, and you do them intentionally, it's like you can see the bigger picture and then that awareness is what will open your heart and get you to go, "Do I really want to live this way? I have to break out of this." This is not what my parents did. I'm living out my mom's story. Do I really want to be doing that? Even just knowing some of the things that have happened in your life, you have a very different trajectory, but what we were wired into—

**Jennifer Spencer 05:42**
From a very young place, it's like in the groove of the record, right? You're trying to undo that. So it's super cool. We can have a whole other call about that, but it's very—

**Steve 05:53**
I was about to say that—that in itself is a three-part series.

**Jennifer Spencer 06:02**
Yeah, exactly.

**Steve 06:04**
Maybe even a five-part series, but that's cool. I'm happy for you, though. I'm happy that you're getting so much out of it. That's the main point, right?

**Jennifer Spencer 06:06**
Exactly.

**Jennifer Spencer 06:10**
Yeah, thank you.

**Steve 06:12**
That's awesome.

**Jennifer Spencer 06:12**
Yeah, it's like that moment when you're like, am I really going to spend this much money on this thing? And then you're like—

**Jennifer Spencer 06:18**
Well, do I want to be miserable for the rest of my life? Those are my options, right?

**Steve 06:23**
Miserable—I mean, it's up there, but yeah.

**Sway Clarke 06:26**
Exactly. Yeah.

**Steve 06:28**
Cool. Well, I don't want to keep everybody too long. I've had a long day. It's Izzy's birthday today.

**Jennifer Spencer 06:29**
So, yeah.

**Jennifer Spencer 06:36**
Oh, my gosh.

**Steve 06:38**
Yeah, she's five.

**Steve 06:39**
And I'm like—

**Jennifer Spencer 06:40**
Oh, my God. Wow.

**Steve 06:41**
I had a nice cry this morning at the table looking at her like, oh my god, she's five.

**Steve 06:47**
Just for some reason in the back of my head, I was like, she's never going to get older. She's just going to be my little baby, right? And then you watch it happen and you're like, fuck.

**Jennifer Spencer 06:54**
Yeah.

**Steve 07:00**
Yeah, no, but she's a good kid. Montego was completely jealous. He doesn't understand that it's her day.

**Sway Clarke 07:07**
And at some point I'm like, yo, no, it's her day. You've got to deal with it. It's life and not everything's fair. It's just what it is.

**Unknown speaker 07:08**
Everyone was present.

**Steve Fernandez 07:17**
But anyway, so basically, in order to get some value and to give some value from a call like this, what I would—

**Steve 07:26**
I mean, has Fernandez told you much about what I'm doing in general? So maybe not.

**Jennifer Spencer 07:30**
Like a little bit but not a lot. I'd love for you to just give me like a cold snap.

**Steve 07:35**
OK, so basically what I'm doing these days is I'm sitting down with small businesses, solo entrepreneurs, and helping them redesign and improve their systems.

**Steve 07:47**
So I'm looking at their current systems, seeing how they're working, doing a bit of a consultation analysis, finding out where the bottlenecks are.

**Sway Clarke 07:56**
And then figuring out, from that, how do we get through the bottom line? What kind of systems do we use? The technical part is not really the important part.

**Steve 08:07**
Sometimes we'll use AI approaches, sometimes it's just automation, sometimes it's basic platforms that already exist but connecting them. So you can use things that are already out there. What I would like to do is just really get an understanding of a couple of things like what is—

**Jennifer Spencer 08:13**
Okay.

**Steve 08:22**
What do they look like day to day? I know everybody always says every day looks different and I totally get that, but I don't mean it in terms—I don't think that you have such a strict—

**Sway Clarke 08:32**
Schedule, but just what does the average day look like? And then there's a couple of key things to keep in mind.

**Sway Clarke 08:40**
What are the things, if you had an assistant? What are those things that you would give to your assistant?

**Jennifer Spencer 08:43**
Mm-hmm.

**Steve 08:46**
And what are the things that just really take a lot of time?

**Steve 08:52**
Because that's really the main thing, being able to say, OK, let's take this task that takes you three or four or six or ten hours a week and see how we can either cut it down or automate it, for example, so that you can use that energy to do something else, right?

**Steve 09:11**
You have Pause and Expand and I know that you have your own brand and there's a few things in there so we probably won't get to it all today. And I know that—

**Steve 09:20**
That's one of my questions too, like how are you balancing both of these things and how do they work? But I guess it's just really, I'd like to talk less.

**Consultant 09:33**
And just kind of hear from you and from Fernandez. What are the things that are on your plate? What does the day look like? What does the week look like? And then what are those things that you'd be like, if I could just magic wand that thing because I fucking hate it, it's just driving me crazy, take that.

**Jennifer Spencer 09:43**
Yes.

**Steve 09:46**
You know, that kind of thing.

**Jennifer Spencer 09:48**
Yeah. Okay. Awesome. That's good context.

**Jennifer Spencer 09:51**
Also like very needed what you're thinking about. So I'll just talk about the stuff that I'm doing with Jennifer Spencer Medium right now. So basically what that business consists of is one-on-one sessions that I do with people. Those are all booked through Calendly. Then I will usually email those people a recording of the session, as well as group sessions that we will go and sell through my Instagram.

**Jennifer Spencer 10:24**
In bigger containers of like say 30 to 40 people.

**Consultant 10:29**
Oh, sorry, all live.

**Jennifer Spencer 10:31**
Live, yeah.

**Consultant 10:32**
Online, there's no recorded.

**Jennifer Spencer 10:34**
Nope, people can buy the recording, but what we're selling is the live experience.

**Consultant 10:40**
Okay.

**Jennifer Spencer 10:42**
So everything is done live. In terms of what takes up the most time there, it's generating and creating the content to actually get them to come through the door. So I spend a lot of time ideating with Steve on—

**Jennifer Spencer 11:00**
What are the topics we're doing? We've been analyzing and transcribing one-on-one sessions that I'm doing and trying to break down, using ChatGPT, what are the main themes that are coming through? But I feel like we never seem to be able to get ahead of, here's the scripts you're recording, now go and do that. Get on your screen right now, make a video and put it online.

**Consultant 11:22**
Sorry, what do you mean you'd never seem to get ahead of it?

**Jennifer Spencer 11:26**
Like I'm always feeling like I have to go and write the script. Steve gives all these ideas, then I have to finesse it and put it in my phone invoice. Then actually record the script. The recording piece and the editing is easy for me. I've learned how to do that in a really short amount of time. The thing that I get bottlenecked on is—

**Jennifer Spencer 11:51**
Where, how am I getting all this content and all these sessions I'm doing?

**Jennifer Spencer 11:57**
How do we get ideas to give me a great script that's in my tone and voice that I can just rinse and repeat, put online? Does that make sense what I'm saying?

**Consultant 12:08**
So I'll try to reiterate. So you have the themes, you have the ideas, like in a general sense, let's say you have a board and you're like, I've got five to ten different ideas we've just brainstormed and now you have to write five to ten scripts for those ideas.

**Consultant 12:23**
And this is your bottleneck here, like now I've got to write these actual things, I've got to edit them, go through them, and then once I've done them, I have to record and edit them and that's really quick. You feel like you've got that down. So your issue right now is the writing of the actual script, getting those into words.

**Jennifer Spencer 12:45**
Yeah, because even if we're using ChatGPT and Steve's pulling ideas out, I, as Jennifer Spencer, the one voicing it, still have to go through and refine it so it sounds like my voice and I just feel like I never have time to do it because I'm always doing one-on-one sessions or trying to—

**Jennifer Spencer 13:03**
Figure something else out with the business to keep growing the next thing. So that's one piece that I think is a challenge.

**Steve 13:10**
And sorry, how much time does this take up, do you think?

**Consultant 13:16**
If you can say in a day or a week, because I don't know how often you do it a week or if you're doing this every day, but how much time would you say that it takes for a script?

**Jennifer Spencer 13:29**
It's probably like a few hours a week. If I were to really sit and focus myself and really write them out, I would say it's like two to three hours of just—

**Jennifer Spencer 13:41**
Over the week just churning out, do I like this? Try it again. Do I like this? Just continually rewriting the script till it feels like, okay, I'm ready to go record it.

**Jennifer Spencer 13:53**
Because once I record it, I'm great. It's just like I need help.

**Jennifer Spencer 13:57**
And it's hard because Steve's not in my head, right? He's not really speaking in my voice.

**Jennifer Spencer 14:04**
He can get me to a certain point and he'll probably say, well, I literally have everything sitting waiting for you.

**Jennifer Spencer 14:11**
It's not that easy to actually then look at the script and go, okay, this is in my tone and voice and I can now record it.

**Consultant 14:18**
Okay. And so—

**Steve Fernandez 14:22**
Can I interject something there really quick?

**Consultant 14:23**
But, you know.

**Steve Fernandez 14:25**
So what we're talking about is, let's call it content creation.

**Steve Fernandez 14:30**
There is also another bucket that Jen has to create that is marketing or selling a product.

**Sway Clarke 14:39**
creation.

**Sway Clarke 14:40**
There's a different bucket.

**Consultant 14:42**
What's the problem? You mean attached to the same end game or are you talking about a different problem?

**Sway Clarke 14:43**
But.

**Steve Fernandez 14:49**
So I think Jen's tasked with being the face of Jennifer Spencer Medium.

**Steve Fernandez 14:57**
So she's not only creating songs, which is the content that gets people in the door and gets followers in and gets people interacting with the brand.

**Steve Fernandez 15:08**
She's then also tasked with coming up with marketing content to sell.

**Sway Clarke 15:15**
let's say shows.

**Steve Fernandez 15:17**
Right. Her shows are one-to-one shows that we monetize or we have group shows.

**Consultant 15:22**
Okay.

**Steve Fernandez 15:23**
That are all live so she's got to create not only the content that gets people interested, which I can call them songs right now, she's also got to go then and create things that people will interact with.

**Jennifer Spencer 15:38**
So like, let's give Sui an example.

**Consultant 15:39**
Yeah, give me something hard-coded. And sorry, the only question I would ask, I'm asking this.

**Sway Clarke 15:41**
We're ready.

**Consultant 15:46**
These two pieces of content are never one and the same.

**Consultant 15:50**
They're always two different pieces of content.

**Jennifer Spencer 15:54**
Pretty much based on the, so I'll give you an example.

**Consultant 15:58**
Okay, so give me an example, yeah.

**Jennifer Spencer 15:59**
You're running a retreat in January. We had 20 spots that we've just sold.

**Steve 16:01**
Yeah.

**Jennifer Spencer 16:05**
But in that process of creating that entire marketing engine to get them to come in,

**Jennifer Spencer 16:12**
We've got to create a reel, me talking about how great Sedona is and how you got to come and see it for yourself. So that script has to be written, recorded.

**Jennifer Spencer 16:21**
I then have to create static story posts to go. There's five spots left. There's three spots left. I have to record stories that are me saying, I just put a reel out telling you about my Sedona retreat. There's only five spots left. So all of that. And then,

**Jennifer Spencer 16:38**
In addition to that, we've also got a newsletter that goes out with all the content writing about Sedona and why we love it. And then we've got,

**Jennifer Spencer 16:52**
What else, Steve?

**Steve Fernandez 16:55**
That's just one of the products that you're selling. You also have to sell your one-on-ones at some point.

**Consultant 17:02**
Mm

**Steve Fernandez 17:03**
Also selling, let's call them workshops. We call them workshops, where these are group workshops of 30 people that get together for specific workshops.

**Steve Fernandez 17:13**
And there's three different workshops we were running at any given time.

**Steve Fernandez 17:17**
And then there are sound baths, which we're trying to also sell tickets towards. And these are monthly sound baths that we do.

**Consultant 17:26**
Okay, so let's just say they're courses for sake of argument. You have different courses. You've got the one-on-one course.

**Consultant 17:36**
Group course, you've got the retreat course, you've also got the sound bath course, for example, and then you want to make

**Steve Fernandez 17:41**
Yeah, sure.

**Consultant 17:43**
Specific targeted marketing content that goes directly back to one of these courses at any given time, right? So let's say if you have five different products, then you're going to have five different

**Consultant 17:57**
Marketing pieces that are going to, and essentially strategies for each that are going to have different pieces of marketing.

**Consultant 18:04**
Leading back to that particular amount of time depending on the person. And then you have,

**Consultant 18:11**
But this is also versus general brand kind of,

**Consultant 18:14**
What you're going to say so then you just have to do, you said to yourself, I want to do daily spirit guide content where I just talk about

**Consultant 18:24**
Whatever that is not directly pointing to a person.

**Steve Fernandez 18:26**
Related courses,

**Consultant 18:27**
Yeah, and I keep consistent with that to keep my brand up and running.

**Sway Clarke 18:27**
Yeah.

**Jennifer Spencer 18:33**
So if you imagine like I'm here as the performer trying to record the thing and get more people through the door because I'm the only one that can do it. We have to first organize, like what are all these events and all the things that have to be promoted when they're supposed to go out? Then we have to create the material to get people to come through the door. And then we have to manage the back end of, okay, this person signed up, we have to send them a reminder email now that this workshop's happening tomorrow. Like there's a lot of like, this is why the idea of having someone that's like, okay, today,

**Jennifer Spencer 19:08**
You are recording these three scripts.

**Jennifer Spencer 19:11**
We are going to put this one out this day and then you're going to do a story that's like this. That would be so helpful for me because I'm not having now to worry about managing the back end, I can just be the person that records and puts all my heart into that and doesn't have to do all the stuff behind the scenes to

**Jennifer Spencer 19:32**
make it happen.

**Steve Fernandez 19:34**
So

**Consultant 19:35**
I mean, it feels like it sounds like there are also two things here you're talking about.

**Consultant 19:41**
The general content management.

**Consultant 19:45**
I have this that needs to be done and like to have, let's say you had an assistant that would say okay Jen today's Monday, here's what we're going to record, here are the pieces. Here's what you got to do. But that script still has to get written.

**Consultant 20:01**
So there's the scripts that have to get written for the content, then there's the organization of the content, of how we're going to do that. Okay. And these two things you're kind of having, you're feeling overwhelmed with, you're like, okay, well, I've got to organize all of this content. I've got to make a schedule, make sure it gets out. But I also have to go into the details of taking the ideation of the content and make it into an actual script that is in my voice and then putting that together. And so right now you don't have much help with that. That's pretty much.

**Jennifer Spencer 20:36**
Well, Steve's an amazing help, but like that is the help. Yeah. So he'll like,

**Consultant 20:37**
all you.

**Consultant 20:40**
Sorry, I didn't want to mean it like that at all. Sorry. I meant it more like once you get... there's a certain point,

**Consultant 20:48**
where it's on your plate. And once it is on your plate, then it's just you. Is what I meant. Okay.

**Jennifer Spencer 20:55**
Mm-hmm.

**Consultant 20:56**
So like Steve said.

**Jennifer Spencer 20:57**
Because I'm the one that has to, and the thing that I'm learning about this whole process is the more personalized you can make it, the more people are going to want to be around you.

**Jennifer Spencer 21:08**
So like, you know this, right? It's like when you talk about your own story, everyone wants to be your friend. And that's what becomes a challenge is I can go and get chat GPT to make all these generic scripts, but it's not me. Right. And so then I have to then go in and go like, okay, how does this sound like me and how do I add in my personal lens to this?

**Jennifer Spencer 21:31**
Which I can happily do, but doing all that and doing that and the other stuff, it just, I go into shutdown mode.

**Consultant 21:41**
Okay, so.

**Jennifer Spencer 21:41**
Like fuck this I'll just get thing on something else and I don't care about anything else.

**Consultant 21:45**
I want to jump to one thing and then I'll jump back to this. When you're doing your general content, you're doing this on Instagram.

**Jennifer Spencer 21:52**
Mm-hmm.

**Consultant 21:52**
Are you also doing general content?

**Consultant 21:55**
It's not a newsletter thing, right? Your Instagram is your main focus.

**Jennifer Spencer 22:02**
Yeah, I basically sometimes we take the concepts from my reels and turn them into a newsletter.

**Jennifer Spencer 22:09**
Not consistent right now.

**Consultant 22:11**
Okay, and so that's the general thing.

**Jennifer Spencer 22:15**
I also don't have other channels. I would love to have a YouTube channel. I would love to be more consistent with TikTok, but I don't have the mental capacity to do all of those things as well.

**Steve 22:25**
Okay, so your main...

**Consultant 22:29**
The focus is the content on IG and then you have all this marketing content around all of these. I totally understand that.

**Consultant 22:39**
Walk me through.

**Consultant 22:43**
How you're currently using your systems right now when you get an idea.

**Consultant 22:48**
Actually, walk me through the whole process.

**Consultant 22:51**
When you start before an idea, Fernandez, when you guys are doing this to

**Consultant 22:56**
I've now edited and I'm about to post this content.

**Consultant 23:01**
Let's just take one piece. Let's take one idea. Walk me through it. How does it work?

**Steve Fernandez 23:04**
So recently, I don't know how to share a screen on this, but we have recently because we got to a point where

**Steve Fernandez 23:13**
In the past, we would get the whiteboard out that's over there in the corner and we'd literally be drawing out what are the ideas that we're going to talk about, grouping them and then coming up with

**Sway Clarke 23:23**
Story.

**Steve Fernandez 23:24**
That was too time consuming.

**Steve Fernandez 23:27**
We'll take a one-on-one recording that she does with someone. So she'll do a one-on-one with Sway Clark.

**Steve Fernandez 23:33**
I'll get the recording, transcribe it into ChatGPT.

**Steve Fernandez 23:40**
Transcribe it into script, take the script, put it into ChatGPT. There is already a

**Consultant 23:44**
Cut and paste.

**Sway Clarke 23:46**
Cut and paste.

**Steve Fernandez 23:48**
ChatGPT already has a directive of

**Steve Fernandez 23:52**
Understanding Jennifer Spencer Medium's audience and it'll break down the script to look for the pain points of whatever Sway was talking about. It'll identify the pain point, identify why you're challenged with this pain point, and it'll identify the remedy for the pain.

**Sway Clarke 24:11**
Great things.

**Steve Fernandez 24:13**
It'll spit it out in a list.

**Steve Fernandez 24:16**
And we'll probably get on average, say, 25 pain points from a one-on-one with you that's an hour long.

**Sway Clarke 24:23**
We then, I then take that.

**Steve Fernandez 24:26**
It's in a Word document.

**Steve Fernandez 24:28**
A Google document. And I'll say to Jen, go through that and highlight in yellow which ones you like, which ones seem interesting to you. She'll highlight, oh, this pain point I think is interesting. Oh, this one's interesting. We then had

**Steve Fernandez 24:42**
You can take the pain point and throw it back into a different prompt and it would write you a script.

**Steve Fernandez 24:49**
And the script was patterned off of two people, Jen and this other media figure named Quinlan.

**Steve Fernandez 25:00**
And Quinlan's got triple the followers of Jen and she's really, really good. She's a really good singer. I call her singer-actor, right? I think Jen's like singing when she gets on the mic and starts talking to her, another really good performer. And it would spit out a script.

**Sway Clarke 25:14**
For Janet.

**Steve Fernandez 25:16**
This is where there's a, I don't know what Jen's doing right now because it sounds to me like Jen's not taking those scripts directly and can use them.

**Steve Fernandez 25:26**
Then Jen would go and record. So at some point, Jen would see a script. She would finesse it with her own writing. I see her usually just sitting and writing. She'll take that script.

**Steve Fernandez 25:36**
Get in front of her camera, record it to the camera.

**Steve Fernandez 25:41**
She's recording by one line at a time. She'll say it, speak it, get the next line, say it, speak it, maybe get two lines, she'll record it, dump it into Descript, editing in Descript.

**Steve 25:54**
Descript, yeah.

**Steve Fernandez 25:55**
Right? Gets it down to her timing.

**Steve Fernandez 26:01**
And then she goes to post onto Instagram and then she'll be piping. I don't know how you're getting your text part for that, Jen. How do you do that?

**Jennifer Spencer 26:05**
I use ChatGPT, I give it the script and I say, can you make me a caption for this?

**Consultant 26:11**
For your subtitles.

**Steve Fernandez 26:11**
And then she'll hit play.

**Jennifer Spencer 26:15**
Like a copy underneath. The bottleneck that I'm having is

**Jennifer Spencer 26:20**
When I go back and look at those scripts,

**Jennifer Spencer 26:23**
Even when we refine it, I have to go back and rethink it myself because it doesn't sound like me when I record it. And the ones that are the most powerful are when I'm thinking of something that just happened to me and then I can quickly write it out and record it.

**Consultant 26:44**
Hmm, okay.

**Jennifer Spencer 26:44**
It's almost like someone to be there with, like, I'm voicing, this is what I want to say now, just make it sound like me and then let me record it.

**Jennifer Spencer 26:55**
The scripts are great, but they're not me. So I have to still go back and re-edit all the work Steve has done.

**Consultant 27:04**
And how much...

**Consultant 27:07**
I don't want to say how much time, that's a vague question.

**Consultant 27:10**
You've built something to make it sound like you already that seems to be not working.

**Jennifer Spencer 27:17**
It's

**Steve Fernandez 27:17**
Yeah.

**Jennifer Spencer 27:18**
not totally me. Yeah. It doesn't sound like me. It sounds like it's ChatGPT.

**Consultant 27:23**
And I'm just curious to dive quickly into that. What did you build and how did you build it? What is it?

**Steve Fernandez 27:32**
I tried to build it off of three powerful Quinlan scripts.

**Steve Fernandez 27:38**
So it's three Quinlan scripts that I really liked or that Jen and I both liked.

**Steve 27:42**
Mm-hmm.

**Steve Fernandez 27:45**
Tried to train ChatGPT on what is she doing? What is Quinlan doing? I gave it the task. I said, we're going to try to build a script writer for Jen Spencer Media. What is Quinlan doing? It analyzed what she was doing and I said, great, take this topic now and write in that fashion.

**Steve Fernandez 28:00**
And Jen felt it was a little bit too her. I said, okay, we need to soften it back a little bit to Jennifer Spencer Media. So maybe it needs to be retrained. Maybe we didn't train it properly.

**Steve 28:10**
Did you ever try to train it on just Jen?

**Consultant 28:19**
Um,

**Steve Fernandez 28:21**
And I'll tell you why I at this point, and it's not because Jen isn't great. I went to this idea because I felt like we were hitting this wall in numbers.

**Steve Fernandez 28:34**
And I was watching this person get numbers and I'm like, it was the same thing out of Sway Clark and Steve Fernandez, like how are they writing this hit, what's the chord structure? I was doing what basketball, my head was there.

**Steve Fernandez 28:48**
I want you to copy her 100% and see what happens.

**Steve Fernandez 28:53**
And we didn't go that far, but it would have been like I wanted her to cover Quinlan and see what happened.

**Steve 28:59**
Mm-hmm.

**Steve 29:01**
Okay.

**Sway Clarke 29:02**
If you've got a very good.

**Consultant 29:02**
Okay, so...

**Steve Fernandez 29:04**
There is something where you could die. I'm so glad we're talking to you about this because you'll know exactly what we're doing right here.

**Steve Fernandez 29:12**
I wanted her to cover her and I don't think Jen fully went to go cover.

**Steve Fernandez 29:18**
And so Jen, you may be saying, hey, it's not fully me because it isn't. It's Quentin.

**Jennifer Spencer 29:23**
Right.

**Steve Fernandez 29:24**
And it's cool if you didn't want to bite her 100%, but I kind of had this thing like, what would happen if we bite her with your voice in your face? What would happen? Because when you see this Quinlan girl, which I'd love you to dissect her sway, she's young, sassy.

**Steve Fernandez 29:40**
Speaker.

**Steve Fernandez 29:44**
But she doesn't have the gravitas or the trust that Jen has. Jen has something about her energy that older women go, oh, she's like Jen's 43. She's not old. But she's not a 30-something.

**Steve 29:57**
She's an experienced person. You have experience. People, yeah.

**Jennifer Spencer 29:57**
Mm-hmm.

**Steve Fernandez 29:59**
Yeah, I trust this white girl here. Quinlan's like, the camera's really... it's...

**Steve Fernandez 30:10**
It's a little bit more, it's less do-it-yourself. It looks more professional. And I even believe because Jen's a little bit do-it-yourself, there's more trust. It's not the filter that Quin's got a heavier filter on her, but...

**Steve Fernandez 30:22**
That's why I think too, Jen, you may not feel 100% comfortable because Quinlan is a little bit different vibe.

**Jennifer Spencer 30:27**
It's more performative and I feel like that's not what gets me people to want to work with.

**Jennifer Spencer 30:33**
The other thing that we have no stats on is like, how much money is this girl making, right? Maybe people just love watching her, but they would never book a coaching session with her. I'm converting. I'm literally filling up my coaching sessions and people are coming and now they're coming to our retreats because they're like, they're all saying to me, I feel like I want to be your friend. I'm like, cool. They're literally like, I just want to be friends with you.

**Consultant 31:01**
I mean, there's a couple of questions I would ask. I don't want to get too deep into analyzing you two because that's not what this is about, but I would say that...

**Jennifer Spencer 31:10**
Wow.

**Consultant 31:13**
I think it's important to determine whether your reading of that script that comes out is actually whether it feels too chat GPT or if it feels too Quinn because those are potentially two different things. Because things can come out and feel chat GPT. I know how that is. Like when you read something and you're like, this just feels mechanical.

**Consultant 31:36**
You know, versus it feels like someone else, right? So I think that's something to think about. And I guess the question I would ask is,

**Jennifer Spencer 31:40**
Totally.

**Consultant 31:45**
What is...

**Consultant 31:46**
What is your...

**Consultant 31:49**
Let's just call it a company and I'm just going to call the whole thing a company because I think that they both work together, right? Pause and expand and Jennifer's the other. Everything kind of feeds into each other, they build off each other.

**Consultant 32:00**
What's the goal?

**Consultant 32:03**
Like what's your KPI and what's your goal in six months or 12 months?

**Consultant 32:07**
So that I just want to kind of understand what do you... In six months, if it looks like this, you say, yes, we've...

**Consultant 32:15**
We've made it further. And in 12 months, we've hit our goal. What would be that benchmark?

**Jennifer Spencer 32:22**
So for me, it's to do...

**Jennifer Spencer 32:27**
More experiences in groups.

**Jennifer Spencer 32:30**
And make more money.

**Jennifer Spencer 32:32**
This is very... I'm just about the money in this sentence I'm saying, but I want to reach more people. That's my ultimate goal. I just want to reach and help more people.

**Jennifer Spencer 32:45**
I am doing a lot of work one-on-one.

**Jennifer Spencer 32:49**
Like as their therapist and it takes a lot of energy out of my system.

**Jennifer Spencer 32:54**
I want to take more of that...

**Jennifer Spencer 32:56**
And move it into group experiences where we can charge more money and I can do less work.

**Consultant 33:02**
And when you say more, what are you doing now and what is more?

**Jennifer Spencer 33:09**
So right now...

**Consultant 33:10**
I'm doing 100 now, 100 people now, and in six months I'd love to do 600 people or like what are the numbers that you're doing now and what's a one-year goal? How many people?

**Jennifer Spencer 33:20**
So this team's probably...

**Steve 33:20**
How much money, how much money and how many people?

**Jennifer Spencer 33:22**
I know because I don't...

**Jennifer Spencer 33:27**
Steve, why don't you tell us why? Because you know.

**Steve Fernandez 33:30**
Oh, I'm glad you're talking to Sway about it. Tell Sway your numbers.

**Jennifer Spencer 33:36**
I don't know Steve to tell.

**Steve Fernandez 33:39**
Hey, what happens when people aren't able to articulate this part of this?

**Consultant 33:45**
Well, I'm not going to get involved here. I didn't ask this to do this. Why I asked this is because...

**Consultant 33:55**
If I'm to work with you, there has to be a goal, right? I have to also know, like, if I'm implementing something, has it worked? Has it not worked? That's one side of it.

**Jennifer Spencer 34:04**
Yeah, right. Yeah.

**Consultant 34:05**
The other side of it is just...

**Consultant 34:07**
It, the systems you implement...

**Consultant 34:11**
Help to get to whatever goal that is, right? You could implement systems that don't get you to that goal. Like if you said, I want to go from, I don't know, 5,000 a month to 50,000 a month in a year.

**Consultant 34:24**
Then the question would be, well, what systems are going to turn those levers?

**Consultant 34:31**
Is it content systems or is it scaling systems in your groups and getting people to pay more? Those are different things, right? So that's why I'm just trying to understand. I'm not trying to drill into you for any other reason to see, like, does she know what she's talking about? I'm just...

**Jennifer Spencer 34:42**
Yes. Okay. So I can tell you, I can tell you a little bit. So the one...

**Consultant 34:44**
I still understand what you guys want out of this, right?

**Jennifer Spencer 34:49**
So the one-on-ones I'm doing, I'm happy with. I'm doing probably somewhere between...

**Jennifer Spencer 34:54**
15 to 17 readings a month.

**Jennifer Spencer 34:59**
And they are booking up and I don't have a problem. I get good repeat customers and that funnel is working.

**Jennifer Spencer 35:08**
We are also trying to move more into group experiences.

**Jennifer Spencer 35:12**
Where I would say right now we do...

**Jennifer Spencer 35:15**
I don't know if we've been doing it long enough to see, Steve, but would you say we're doing like one every two months?

**Jennifer Spencer 35:22**
So that's 30 people at $88 a person.

**Jennifer Spencer 35:26**
How much is that statement?

**Steve Fernandez 35:29**
$2,839, $2,600 American.

**Jennifer Spencer 35:34**
Yeah. So that I'd like to increase that to say doing...

**Jennifer Spencer 35:39**
I mean, if I could do like two or three a month, that would be great.

**Steve Fernandez 35:43**
I mean, before you even try to answer this, Jen, I think this is one you're starting to find a challenge. This is one of the...

**Steve Fernandez 35:50**
This is one of the, what's the right word?

**Steve Fernandez 35:54**
This is a gap.

**Jennifer Spencer 35:55**
It's a gap. Yeah.

**Steve Fernandez 35:56**
It's a gap for us because...

**Steve Fernandez 36:00**
Up until two months ago, and Sway knows about my financial issues right now. I wasn't pressing any levers down to say, hey, we have to make X amount of dollars. So we've literally built this at a speed where we weren't putting the pressure of a dollar figure on it.

**Jennifer Spencer 36:18**
Mm-hmm.

**Steve Fernandez 36:18**
And now, when you say what you just said, I'm like, fuck, this is a shit ton of work to only make.

**Sway Clarke 36:26**
six grand a month.

**Steve Fernandez 36:28**
Right. Or seven grand a month. But that's not a lot of money.

**Steve Fernandez 36:33**
And so I think we have to take a step back and kind of get some help on like, well, how do we scale this? Maybe we're not scaling this appropriately.

**Jennifer Spencer 36:45**
Hmm.

**Steve Fernandez 36:46**
You know, maybe it isn't 30 people at $80. The dude guys, I ain't going to cut it.

**Jennifer Spencer 36:52**
Well, there's also like the whole pause and expand side, which is very—

**Consultant 36:57**
Wait a minute. Let me get there for a second.

**Steve Fernandez 37:00**
The thing that we've done well is we've got this pretty wide smorgasbord of offerings.

**Steve Fernandez 37:10**
From a monetary point of view, we'll make 20 grand U.S. on the retreat for four days.

**Steve Fernandez 37:19**
And it hasn't cost us a lot of money to do that. It didn't cost a lot of marketing money. It's already sold.

**Steve Fernandez 37:28**
It wasn't a lot of risk. It wasn't a lot of effort. So there's something there that's interesting to me in the retreat game.

**Consultant 37:35**
Sorry, that's $20,000 after costs?

**Sway Clarke 37:36**
As a business.

**Steve Fernandez 37:38**
Yeah, so we'll grow. If you grossed say like 28,000 American.

**Steve Fernandez 37:45**
And I think our expenses might come to five grand, six grand on the whole thing. So I'm going 20 profit.

**Sway Clarke 37:52**
Which isn't bad for a first one, right? And we were pretty cheap.

**Sway Clarke 37:57**
So.

**Steve Fernandez 37:58**
That's an area that I want to focus on and try to grow because if you can start to really fill those, that can be a profit center of 20 grand a pop.

**Steve Fernandez 38:12**
You do a number of those per quarter, even three a quarter. That's pretty good money.

**Steve Fernandez 38:19**
And then does it require you to do all these other in-person virtual things?

**Consultant 38:27**
You mean just more focusing on higher ticket items?

**Steve Fernandez 38:30**
Higher ticket items. Yeah. I think the one-on-ones are good for Jen in terms of bringing people in the door. She gets paid $250 American for an hour. It's great because she's meeting people and those are actually funneling to the retreat, believe it or not.

**Steve 38:46**
This is what I was going to say, right? So you—

**Consultant 38:47**
Yeah.

**Steve Fernandez 38:49**
They don't really care about coming to an $88 teach me about something for 90 minutes. They want the one-on-one stuff, so they're kind of going straight to the retreat.

**Steve Fernandez 38:59**
That funnel coming in the door, I see that working.

**Steve Fernandez 39:04**
The outlier to this whole thing is meditation class.

**Steve Fernandez 39:09**
And the reason I call it an outlier is we've been doing this thing where we get up for twice a week in the mornings and meditate with people. In a half hour they get a visualization, a soundbath, and a talk with us, and we meet as a community.

**Steve Fernandez 39:23**
And we had a new person come in the door who was blown away by it, signed up.

**Steve Fernandez 39:29**
She's paying 40 bucks American a month for it. And she's like, this is a podcast. She's like, you guys are actually doing a podcast every morning. She's like, you need to get your stuff out there. People need to know about this. And that this is something that I'm not sure people are going to come for the membership of it, but it's going to get your name out there because it's so good. You guys talking about your lives every morning.

**Steve Fernandez 39:52**
And that to me is sitting right there. All these things are already edited. They're sitting as MP3s.

**Steve Fernandez 39:58**
We've got hundreds of them, literally hundreds, sitting behind a paywall.

**Steve Fernandez 40:04**
So that's another idea there where we could use help in going, okay, you've got this ongoing podcast.

**Steve Fernandez 40:11**
How do you use this podcast as a way to get people in the door to find out about you?

**Steve Fernandez 40:17**
And bring them into your ecosystem of products of what you want to sell.

**Steve 40:22**
So when you say it's behind a paywall—

**Steve 40:25**
What do you mean by that?

**Steve Fernandez 40:26**
It means you have to be a member in order to access the recordings or come to the recordings.

**Consultant 40:26**
Where is it safe?

**Sway Clarke 40:33**
It was a free two-week trial, but—

**Jennifer Spencer 40:34**
And most people, like I always say this to Steve, I wouldn't fucking sign up for that. It's like a major commitment. It's like a gym membership, but for your mind and people don't see the value of that. Like I'll pay $250 to go to a gym where they train me, but to pay even $40 a month, twice a week to be meditating with a group, it's not as appealing to me. It's more an older audience of women that are—

**Jennifer Spencer 40:58**
Like 60, that have no friends and are lonely and divorced, that want to be a part of it because they need community.

**Steve Fernandez 41:08**
And I think what we got, sometimes you come up with an idea and you do it so long that you can't see it's actually something else.

**Steve 41:17**
Mm-hmm.

**Steve Fernandez 41:18**
And what girl, her name's Anya, so I'll refer to her as Anya. She's like, you guys run a podcast. You just are trying to make a membership out of it, but it's actually a podcast. So why don't you put the podcast—

**Steve Fernandez 41:29**
Get it out to the world. Stop trying to hide it. Just release it, talk about it. Jen's got an audience.

**Steve Fernandez 41:35**
She's literally got an audience that wants to get more of Jen. Well, give her Jen and Steve on the podcast. Just get it out there.

**Steve 41:41**
Mm-hmm.

**Steve Fernandez 41:42**
Stop worrying about monetizing it because we're not making any money on it. We've got 50 paying members at an average price of, say, 25 bucks a head, which was the original price. It's not about money.

**Steve Fernandez 41:53**
I put it to you because I think someone smart will go, this is really good content. You've got hours of it. You might get people becoming fans of you through this as well.

**Steve Fernandez 42:06**
It's not a heavy lift for you to get it out there. It's not a heavy lift to promote it.

**Steve Fernandez 42:11**
You're already doing it. This is how it can help you create those bigger numbers you want, the bigger following.

**Consultant 42:20**
Yeah, I mean there's a lot in there.

**Consultant 42:25**
I think you're always going to have—

**Steve 42:28**
A bottleneck for scaling because you're doing live.

**Consultant 42:32**
You've decided to focus on doing live events and focusing on not doing apps and all that kind of stuff, but we're going to focus on live.

**Consultant 42:41**
That is going to always have a bottleneck in terms of how many people you can scale to.

**Consultant 42:48**
How many you can do without breaking.

**Consultant 42:52**
The energy. Because you're not going to do 500 people in a group session in Sedona, right? That's just not going to have the same energy as 20. So the only way to scale that is to make the ticket so high.

**Jennifer Spencer 43:01**
Mm-hmm.

**Consultant 43:06**
That people go in for like, I don't know, five grand a pop or something. You just make it that number. This is what it is. Those people will pay and you have that thing.

**Consultant 43:21**
In terms of the content, I mean, you guys definitely know Alex Hermosi, right? You kind of know who this dude is, right?

**Consultant 43:34**
The dude put out 36 thousand pieces of content last year.

**Consultant 43:44**
He just put that out. He's got a machine behind him, obviously, but the point is not about the amount, it's the fact that content is not paywalled.

**Consultant 43:58**
People put it out as authority, as credibility, as content in order to sell something later. So you've got to keep going with the content. It's like the content game, right?

**Consultant 44:14**
I think you can do it a couple of ways. I think if you want to say, okay, I want to keep this membership group, then I would add.

**Consultant 44:23**
I'm always about adding more value on it. You're basically saying, look, we're going to open up these podcasts, we're going to turn this to a free podcast, but for those of you that are in the group, you're going to now get this, this and this on top of it. So if you want to stay with the membership, you're going to get all these added bonuses.

**Consultant 44:40**
But the show, let's say the hour-long show, is going to be a free show.

**Consultant 44:48**
That show will just be put out every week, twice a week or whatever that is, and use that as free content that drives back to the membership and drives back to Sedona and drives back to the one-on-ones, but you have a constant flow of content. If you're able to produce that content very quickly, then it becomes low intensity but high impact.

**Jennifer Spencer 45:17**
Yep.

**Consultant 45:17**
Right? So it is one way to look at it. I kind of understand what this woman is talking about.

**Consultant 45:24**
Especially if you're saying we've got loads of content that is behind a paywall that is not serving us financially.

**Steve Fernandez 45:31**
Well, I actually don't even think people are going to care if it starts dripping out onto a Spotify for free because we can be giving them content that's six months old. The content is not that it goes old.

**Steve Fernandez 45:44**
The content are morning meditations that we're doing with this community. We talk about different topics. The topics are timeless.

**Steve Fernandez 45:53**
The people that are coming in the morning right now come because they want a wake-up call. They actually want to get up at 8:30, and this is what they want to do on the Mondays and Wednesdays with us. It's part of their routine of their day. They've bought into that already. I don't think they're going to care if these things start coming out now publicly.

**Steve Fernandez 46:10**
And these are topics from three months ago. They could care less.

**Jennifer Spencer 46:14**
However, I mean, it is true.

**Consultant 46:15**
I don't know. It is a question. Sorry to cut you, Jen. But it is a question I don't think you should answer so quickly.

**Jennifer Spencer 46:18**
Is it?

**Consultant 46:22**
Because I think people subscribe and pay for something because they're exclusive. I'm a part of that group and I get that thing, not the next door neighbor. So there are people that are going to say, hold on, if I just have to wait two months and get that episode, why am I paying for this? I'll just wait two months. I'll just get the episodes like everybody else. Right. And so there is that side of it.

**Consultant 46:46**
You stack, right? You basically say, we'll give you this extra thing here or these extra two things. This is what the members get. And then this is what the free version gets. Who else does this?

**Consultant 46:57**
Sam, what's his name?

**Jennifer Spencer 47:01**
Oh, Harris?

**Consultant 47:02**
Sam Harris.

**Consultant 47:04**
He does this, right? He does this with the Wake Up app, but he also does it with his free podcast. He puts a podcast out but he only puts out like an hour of it or two hours.

**Jennifer Spencer 47:14**
Yeah, it was.

**Consultant 47:18**
The third hour. If you want the full one, then you've got to subscribe. But every week you get a new podcast and if you just want to listen to podcasts, you can get it. So it is something to think about.

**Consultant 47:31**
