## Discovery Call Feedback (December 2, 2025)

### On Current Pain Points

**Jennifer on script writing bottleneck:**
> "I'm always feeling like I have to go and write the script. Steve gives all these ideas, then I have to finesse it and put it in my phone invoice. Then actually record the script. The recording piece and the editing is easy for me. I've learned how to do that in a really short amount of time. The thing that I get bottlenecked on is— Where, how am I getting all this content and all these sessions I'm doing? How do we get ideas to give me a great script that's in my tone and voice that I can just rinse and repeat, put online?"

**Jennifer on authenticity requirements:**
> "Even if we're using ChatGPT and Steve's pulling ideas out, I, as Jennifer Spencer, the one voicing it, still have to go through and refine it so it sounds like my voice and I just feel like I never have time to do it because I'm always doing one-on-one sessions or trying to figure something else out with the business to keep growing the next thing."

**Jennifer on AI-generated scripts:**
> "The scripts are great, but they're not me. So I have to still go back and re-edit all the work Steve has done."

> "It doesn't sound like me. It sounds like it's ChatGPT."

**Jennifer on content production challenge:**
> "Because I'm the one that has to, and the thing that I'm learning about this whole process is the more personalized you can make it, the more people are going to want to be around you. So like, you know this, right? It's like when you talk about your own story, everyone wants to be your friend. And that's what becomes a challenge is I can go and get chat GPT to make all these generic scripts, but it's not me. Right. And so then I have to then go in and go like, okay, how does this sound like me and how do I add in my personal lens to this? Which I can happily do, but doing all that and doing that and the other stuff, it just, I go into shutdown mode."

**Jennifer on overwhelm:**
> "Like fuck this I'll just get thing on something else and I don't care about anything else."

### On What They Need

**Jennifer on ideal workflow:**
> "This is why the idea of having someone that's like, okay, today, you are recording these three scripts. We are going to put this one out this day and then you're going to do a story that's like this. That would be so helpful for me because I'm not having now to worry about managing the back end, I can just be the person that records and puts all my heart into that and doesn't have to do all the stuff behind the scenes to make it happen."

**Jennifer on voice assistance:**
> "It's almost like someone to be there with, like, I'm voicing, this is what I want to say now, just make it sound like me and then let me record it."

### On Business Strategy

**Jennifer on current membership:**
> "And most people, like I always say this to Steve, I wouldn't fucking sign up for that. It's like a major commitment. It's like a gym membership, but for your mind and people don't see the value of that. Like I'll pay $250 to go to a gym where they train me, but to pay even $40 a month, twice a week to be meditating with a group, it's not as appealing to me."

**Steve on meditation content opportunity:**
> "All these things are already edited. They're sitting as MP3s. We've got hundreds of them, literally hundreds, sitting behind a paywall. So that's another idea there where we could use help in going, okay, you've got this ongoing podcast. How do you use this podcast as a way to get people in the door to find out about you? And bring them into your ecosystem of products of what you want to sell."

**Steve on current reality check:**
> "And now, when you say what you just said, I'm like, fuck, this is a shit ton of work to only make six grand a month. Right. Or seven grand a month. But that's not a lot of money. And so I think we have to take a step back and kind of get some help on like, well, how do we scale this? Maybe we're not scaling this appropriately."

### On Their Strengths

**Jennifer on her conversion power:**
> "I'm converting. I'm literally filling up my coaching sessions and people are coming and now they're coming to our retreats because they're like, they're all saying to me, I feel like I want to be your friend. I'm like, cool. They're literally like, I just want to be friends with you."

**Jennifer on authenticity vs. performance:**
> "It's more performative and I feel like that's not what gets me people to want to work with."

**Steve on retreat success:**
> "From a monetary point of view, we'll make 20 grand U.S. on the retreat for four days. And it hasn't cost us a lot of money to do that. It didn't cost a lot of marketing money. It's already sold. It wasn't a lot of risk. It wasn't a lot of effort. So there's something there that's interesting to me in the retreat game."

### Third-Party Feedback (Anya - Member)

**On meditation content:**
Steve reporting Anya's feedback:
> "She's like, you guys are actually doing a podcast every morning. She's like, you need to get your stuff out there. People need to know about this. And that this is something that I'm not sure people are going to come for the membership of it, but it's going to get your name out there because it's so good. You guys talking about your lives every morning."

### On Therapy and Personal Growth

**Jennifer on ketamine therapy impact:**
> "Yeah, it literally changed my life. I don't even—"

> "It's pretty amazing when—it's almost like you can see the patterns of what you keep circling around in, but then you don't know how to get out of the loop. I'm trying rationally to make a change and do something different and you just don't know how to break the cycle. But when you do these psychedelics, whether it's ketamine or mushrooms or whatever it is, and you do them intentionally, it's like you can see the bigger picture and then that awareness is what will open your heart and get you to go, 'Do I really want to live this way? I have to break out of this.' This is not what my parents did. I'm living out my mom's story. Do I really want to be doing that?"

**Steve on Jennifer's therapy journey:**
> "I was telling Sway about your ketamine journeys and how proud I am of you. He was asking me about what changed."

> "I got to give her credit because this is the most intense kind of therapy you can do where it's psychedelic-assisted. And so when someone takes that jump. Free willingly to do it. That to me is like I'm putting the gauntlet down and going. Like I'm going to look for it."

**Steve on Jennifer's position in the field:**
> "Also, it's not being talked about, so what's interesting is Jen's in a place where she can speak to this. Not have to keep it under wraps like, 'Oh, I did this thing on the low,' and you're at the front of this therapy in a way that you can talk to it and be very informed about it. You've got language to speak about it and you've got a following to speak to about it, so Jen's in a very interesting place when I think about talking into psychiatric-assisted therapy. Interesting place."

### Positive Reactions to Consultation

**Steve on call value:**
> "This was great making us think, so I appreciate it."

**Jennifer confirming need:**
> "Yeah. Okay. Awesome. That's good context. Also like very needed what you're thinking about."

**Jennifer on investment mindset:**
> "Yeah, it's like that moment when you're like, am I really going to spend this much money on this thing? And then you're like— Well, do I want to be miserable for the rest of my life? Those are my options, right?"
