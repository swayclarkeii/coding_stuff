# Decisions Log - Jennifer Spencer Project

**Purpose:** Track key decisions made throughout the project to maintain clarity and avoid revisiting settled questions.

---

## Decision 1: Focus on Jennifer Spencer Medium First
**Date:** December 2, 2025
**Made By:** Implied in discovery call scope
**Context:** Initial call focused entirely on Jennifer Spencer Medium business (personal brand), not Pause + Expand (corporate wellness)

**Decision:**
Begin with Jennifer Spencer Medium systems; address Pause + Expand integration later

**Rationale:**
- Jennifer Spencer Medium is where the immediate pain points are
- Clear revenue model and metrics to track
- Corporate side wasn't discussed in detail during discovery
- Can revisit integration once personal brand systems are operational

**Impact:**
- Project scope is narrower and more focused
- May need separate discovery for Pause + Expand later
- Systems built should consider future integration

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed

## Decision 2: Prioritize Content Creation Over Everything Else
**Date:** December 2, 2025
**Made By:** Identified as primary bottleneck in discovery
**Context:** Jennifer spends 2-3 hours/week rewriting AI-generated scripts because they don't sound like her

**Decision:**
Voice model training and content workflow optimization is Priority #1

**Rationale:**
- This is the biggest time drain
- It's blocking content volume increase
- Jennifer experiences overwhelm from this specifically
- Solving this unlocks other opportunities (multi-channel, consistency)
- Quick wins (podcast) can happen in parallel

**Impact:**
- Voice model development starts immediately
- Content calendar system is second priority
- Backend automation follows once content production is fixed

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed

## Decision 3: Release Meditation Content as Podcast
**Date:** December 2, 2025
**Made By:** Strong consensus from call (Sway recommendation + Anya's feedback)
**Context:** Hundreds of edited meditation recordings sitting behind paywall generating only $1,250-$2K/month from 50 members

**Decision:**
Release meditation content as free podcast, add value stack for paying members

**Rationale:**
- Asset already exists (low effort to deploy)
- Current paywall isn't generating significant revenue
- Free content builds authority and audience (Alex Hormozi model)
- "Prince's vault" - content serves no one behind paywall
- Similar to Sam Harris model (free podcast + paid app)
- New member (Anya) explicitly said "this is a podcast, get it out there"

**Options Considered:**
A) Keep behind paywall (current state) - rejected due to limited reach
B) Release everything free - rejected, devalues membership
C) Freemium model with value stack - **SELECTED**
D) Delay release (6 months behind live sessions) - possible variation

**Impact:**
- Need to redesign membership value proposition
- Need podcast hosting platform
- Need launch strategy
- Risk: Current members may feel value decreased
- Opportunity: Significant audience growth potential

**Open Questions:**
- Delay strategy (6 months) or curated selection?
- What specific perks do paying members get?
- How to announce change to current members?

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed direction, details TBD

## Decision 4: Don't Copy Quinlan's Style
**Date:** December 2, 2025 (clarified during call)
**Made By:** Jennifer (with Sway's validation)
**Context:** Steve had been training AI on Quinlan (competitor with 3x followers) to try to replicate her success

**Decision:**
Train AI specifically on Jennifer's authentic voice, not Quinlan's performative style

**Rationale:**
- Jennifer's strength is authenticity and trust ("want to be your friend")
- Quinlan's style is young, sassy, performative - not Jennifer's brand
- Jennifer converts well despite fewer followers (fills coaching sessions)
- Quinlan's monetization is unknown (followers ≠ revenue)
- Scripts felt inauthentic to Jennifer, requiring rewrites (defeating the purpose)
- Different value propositions: entertainment vs. transformation

**Impact:**
- Previous Quinlan-based prompts are deprecated
- Need fresh voice model training from Jennifer's content
- May see slower follower growth but better conversion
- Maintains brand integrity

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed

## Decision 5: Live Experiences Remain Core
**Date:** December 2, 2025 (reaffirmed)
**Made By:** Jennifer and Steve (founding principle)
**Context:** Founded March 2020 with explicit philosophy: "Live experiences over apps - human connection focus"

**Decision:**
Maintain commitment to live experiences; don't pivot to recorded courses/apps

**Rationale:**
- Core brand differentiator
- Where Jennifer excels (connection, presence)
- Market is saturated with recorded content
- Clients value live interaction
- Retreat model is most profitable

**Impact:**
- Inherent scaling limitations acknowledged
- Growth comes from frequency or price, not volume
- Systems should support live model, not replace it
- Automation focuses on marketing and admin, not delivery

**Constraint:**
- Can't serve 500 people in intimate setting
- Jennifer's energy is finite resource
- Business model caps unless ticket prices increase significantly

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed

## Decision 6: Start with Instagram, Expand Later
**Date:** December 2, 2025
**Made By:** Implicit in current focus
**Context:** Jennifer wants YouTube and consistent TikTok but lacks capacity. Current primary channel is Instagram (119K followers).

**Decision:**
Optimize Instagram content workflow first, add other platforms only after it's streamlined

**Rationale:**
- Instagram is working (119K followers, engagement, conversions)
- Adding channels before fixing workflow adds overwhelm
- Better to do one channel excellently than three poorly
- Once content creation is smooth, cross-posting is easier

**Impact:**
- YouTube and TikTok are Phase 3-4, not Phase 1
- Initial systems built for Instagram
- Design with multi-channel in mind for future
- Newsletter remains secondary (repurposed IG content)

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed

## Decisions Not to Revisit (Settled)

These were considered and closed. Don't reopen without significant new information:

- ❌ Pivot to recorded courses instead of live (conflicts with brand mission)
- ❌ Copy Quinlan's style (not authentic to Jennifer)
- ❌ Wait on podcast until "perfect" (good enough to launch, iterate based on feedback)
- ❌ Build everything before launching anything (quick wins while building foundation)
