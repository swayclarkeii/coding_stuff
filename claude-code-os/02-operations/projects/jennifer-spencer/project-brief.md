## Revenue Breakdown (Jennifer Spencer Medium)

**Current: ~$6K-$7.5K/month base + retreat spikes**

| Offering | Frequency | Price | Monthly Revenue | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| One-on-Ones | 15-17/month | $250 | $3,750-$4,250 | ✅ Working well, funnel to retreats |
| Group Workshops | ~1 every 2 months | $88 × 30-40 people | ~$1,300 avg | ⚠️ Want 2-3/month |
| Meditation Membership | Ongoing | $25-40 × 50 members | $1,250-$2,000 | ⚠️ Underutilized asset |
| Retreats | Quarterly | Example: $28K gross | $20K net/event | ✅ Best ROI, sold out |

**Key Insight:** Retreats are highest profit margin (71%), but current model relies heavily on Jennifer's one-on-one energy which is draining.

## Primary Challenge

**Content Creation Bottleneck (2-3 hours/week)**

Jennifer must manually rewrite all AI-generated scripts to match her authentic voice.

**Current Workflow:**
1. Session → Transcription → AI identifies 25 pain points
2. AI generates scripts (trained on competitor, not Jennifer)
3. ❌ **BOTTLENECK:** Jennifer rewrites everything to sound like herself
4. Records in Descript (fast)
5. Posts to Instagram

**What's Needed:**
- AI trained on Jennifer's actual voice/style
- Content calendar system ("Today record these 3 scripts")
- Backend automation (reminders, sequences, posting)

---

## The Big Opportunity

**Hidden Asset:** Hundreds of edited meditation recordings sitting behind membership paywall

**Current State:**
- 50 members paying $25-40/month
- Generating only $1,250-$2K/month
- Member feedback: "This is a podcast. Get it out there."

**Strategy:**
- Release as free podcast (authority building, audience growth)
- Add value stack for paying members (live participation, community, early access)
- Similar to Sam Harris Wake Up model

---

## Goals (Being Clarified)

**Stated Objectives:**
- ✅ More group experiences (less draining than one-on-ones)
- ✅ Make more money
- ✅ Reach more people
- ✅ Reduce time on admin/backend

**Quantified Goals (TBD):**
- Revenue target: 6 months / 12 months?
- Workshop frequency: 1 every 2 months → 2-3/month
- Retreat frequency: Increase from current
- Time savings: 50% reduction in admin hours?

**Strategic Tension:**
- Live-only model has inherent scaling limitations
- Can't do 500-person retreats and maintain intimacy
- Options: Increase prices or increase frequency

---

## What's Working

✅ One-on-one conversion and booking (sold out regularly)
✅ Retreat model (sold out, $20K profit, minimal marketing spend)
✅ Instagram presence and engagement (119K followers)
✅ Authentic brand ("I feel like I want to be your friend")
✅ One-on-ones → Retreat funnel

---

## What's Not Working

❌ Script writing bottleneck (AI doesn't sound like Jennifer)
❌ $88 workshops not converting well (people skip to retreats)
❌ Meditation membership plateaued at ~$1.5K/month
❌ Content organization (no calendar system)
❌ Manual backend work (reminders, emails, posting)
❌ Multi-channel presence (TikTok, YouTube inconsistent)
❌ Unclear revenue goals and metrics

---

## Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1: Fix Content Workflow
- Voice model training (train on Jennifer, not Quinlan)
- Content calendar system
- Batch recording system
- Automated posting

### Priority 2: Leverage Existing Assets
- Release meditation recordings as podcast (quick win)
- Repurpose one-on-one sessions into content pieces
- Build content bank from existing material

### Priority 3: Backend Automation
- Workshop/retreat reminder sequences
- Member onboarding automation
- Email marketing setup
- CRM integration

### Priority 4: Revenue Optimization
- Retreat frequency and/or pricing
- Workshop positioning and marketing
- Membership value stack redesign
- Clear funnel architecture

## Tech Stack (Current - Partial)

**Known:**
- Instagram (primary channel)
- Calendly (one-on-one booking)
- ChatGPT (script ideation)
- Descript (video editing)
- Facebook Group (membership community)
- Google Docs (collaboration)
- Email (manual)

**Unknown/Needed:**
- CRM system
- Email platform
- Payment processor
- Content calendar tool
- Podcast hosting

---

## Unique Considerations

**Jennifer's Work Style:**
- Goes into "shutdown mode" when overwhelmed
- Values authenticity above all
- Won't compromise genuine connection for scale
- Strong personal storytelling ability
- Best content comes from real experiences

**Recent Context:**
- Completed 3 weeks ketamine therapy ($700/session)
- Weekly therapy ongoing
- Could be future content/authority angle
- Financial pressure applied ~2 months ago (Steve)

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Different from "Quinlan" (competitor with 3x followers)
- Quinlan: Young, sassy, performative, heavy filters
- Jennifer: Experienced, trusted, vulnerable, authentic
- Jennifer's conversion may be higher despite fewer followers

---

## Success Indicators

**We'll know this is working when:**
- Jennifer spends <30 min/week finalizing scripts (vs. current 2-3 hours)
- Content calendar is populated 30 days in advance
- Workshop frequency increases to 2-3/month
- Podcast launches and gains audience
- Backend operations run with minimal manual intervention
- Revenue increases while Jennifer's energy output decreases

---

## Next Actions

**Immediate:**
1. Define concrete 6-month and 12-month revenue goals
2. Audit complete tech stack (payments, email, CRM)
3. Collect Jennifer's 20-30 best content pieces for voice training
4. Choose podcast hosting platform
5. Prioritize requirements (must-have vs. nice-to-have)

**Pending Decisions:**
- Budget allocation
- Timeline expectations
- Pause + Expand integration strategy
- Potential VA/team member hiring

## Key Quotes from Discovery

**Jennifer on authenticity:**
"The more personalized you can make it, the more people are going to want to be around you. When you talk about your own story, everyone wants to be your friend."

**Jennifer on overwhelm:**
"I go into shutdown mode. Like fuck this I'll just get thing on something else and I don't care about anything else."

**Steve on current reality:**
"This is a shit ton of work to only make six grand a month, seven grand a month. That's not a lot of money."

**Steve on membership opportunity:**
"We've got hundreds of [recordings], literally hundreds, sitting behind a paywall. I think someone smart will go, this is really good content."

**Jennifer on retreats:**
"They're all saying to me, I feel like I want to be your friend. They're literally like, I just want to be friends with you."

---

## Project Approach

**Philosophy:** Systematize operations without losing the human touch that makes Jennifer's brand successful.

**Method:** Start with quick wins (podcast, voice model), build foundational systems (CRM, calendar), then scale (multi-channel, team).

**Non-Negotiables:**
- Must preserve Jennifer's authentic voice
- Must reduce overwhelm, not increase it
- Systems should be simple and maintainable
- Focus on leverage, not just more work
