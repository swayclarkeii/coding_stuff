## Notes

**Retreat Timing:** January 29-February 1 Sedona retreat is already booked and sold. Not enough time to implement full systems before this event, but can document learnings for future retreats.

**Focus:** Start with content creation workflow (biggest pain point) and podcast launch (quickest win). Build automation systems in parallel.

**Mindset:** Small wins that reduce Jennifer's overwhelm > Big complex systems that increase cognitive load.

---

**Action Item Review Cadence:** Weekly during implementation, then bi-weekly during optimization phase.
