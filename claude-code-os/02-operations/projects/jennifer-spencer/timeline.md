## Critical Path Items

These items must be completed before others can proceed:

1. **Revenue Goals Defined** → Required before prioritizing features
2. **Tech Stack Audit** → Required before tool selection
3. **Budget Allocation** → Required before platform subscriptions
4. **Voice Model v1** → Unblocks content creation workflow
5. **CRM Selection** → Foundation for all automation
6. **Content Calendar** → Provides structure for all content

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Jennifer's availability for content samples collection
- Steve's input on technical requirements
- Budget approval
- Client decision on tool selections

### Internal Dependencies
- Voice model must work before scaling content production
- CRM must be configured before email sequences
- Content calendar must exist before automation workflows
- Podcast platform must be selected before upload

## Milestones & Decision Points

### Milestone 1: Foundation Complete (Week 4)
**Decision Point:** Is voice model producing usable scripts?
- ✅ If YES: Proceed to automation phase
- ❌ If NO: Iterate on voice model before proceeding

### Milestone 2: Automation Live (Week 8)
**Decision Point:** Are automated sequences performing well?
- ✅ If YES: Begin optimization and expansion
- ❌ If NO: Debug and refine before adding complexity

### Milestone 3: Podcast Launched (Week 8)
**Decision Point:** Is podcast gaining traction?
- ✅ If YES: Plan growth strategies
- ❌ If NO: Adjust content or promotion strategy

### Milestone 4: Systems Optimized (Week 12)
**Decision Point:** Has Jennifer's time on admin decreased significantly?
- ✅ If YES: Begin scale phase (multi-channel, team)
- ❌ If NO: Identify remaining pain points, iterate

## Timeline Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Sedona Retreat Timeline Pressure
**Risk:** Retreat is January 29-Feb 1, 2026 - systems may not be fully implemented in time
**Mitigation:**
- Document this retreat manually for learnings
- Focus on voice model and content calendar first (can help with future retreat marketing)
- Full retreat automation ready for next event

### Risk 2: Voice Model Doesn't Match Jennifer's Voice
**Risk:** If AI can't capture Jennifer's authentic voice, primary bottleneck remains
**Mitigation:**
- Multiple iteration cycles built into timeline
- Fallback: Improve workflow efficiency even if full automation isn't possible
- Regular check-ins with Jennifer during development

### Risk 3: Budget Constraints Limit Tool Selection
**Risk:** Ideal tools may be too expensive, requiring compromises
**Mitigation:**
- Identify free/low-cost alternatives
- Prioritize must-have features
- Phase tool upgrades over time
- Start with basics, upgrade as revenue grows

### Risk 4: Client Decision Delays
**Risk:** Waiting on budget/strategy decisions could push timeline
**Mitigation:**
- Prepare multiple options (good/better/best)
- Work on no-cost items while awaiting decisions
- Keep communication frequent
- Set clear decision deadlines

## Retreat Schedule Impact

Understanding retreat timing helps plan content needs:

### Known Retreat
- **Sedona:** January 29 - February 1, 2026 (sold out)
- **Marketing Window:** Too short for full system implementation
- **Opportunity:** Document process for future automation

### Future Retreats (Estimate)
If goal is 3-4 retreats/year:
- Q1 2026: Sedona (complete)
- Q2 2026: TBD location
- Q3 2026: TBD location
- Q4 2026: TBD location

**Content Planning:** Each retreat needs 8-10 weeks advance marketing. Systems should be in place by March 2026 for Q2 retreat.

---

## Workshop Schedule Impact

Current: 1 every 2 months
Goal: 2-3/month

### Scaling Timeline
- **Month 1-2:** Continue current cadence while building systems
- **Month 3-4:** Increase to 1/month with new automation
- **Month 5-6:** Increase to 2/month
- **Month 7+:** Sustain 2-3/month with optimized systems

---

## Success Timeline Checkpoints

### 30-Day Check
- Is Jennifer spending less time on scripts?
- Is content calendar populated?
- Are voice model outputs improving?

### 60-Day Check
- Have we eliminated major manual tasks?
- Is podcast gaining listeners?
- Are email sequences working?

### 90-Day Check
- Has revenue increased?
- Are workshops happening more frequently?
- Is Jennifer less overwhelmed?

### 6-Month Check
- Have we hit 6-month revenue goal?
- Are all systems running smoothly?
- Is multi-channel expansion working?
- Is team expansion needed?

---

## Flexible vs. Fixed Deadlines

### Fixed Deadlines
- Sedona Retreat: January 29, 2026 (immovable)
- Tax year planning: December 31, 2026 (if relevant)

### Flexible Deadlines
- Voice model completion: ASAP but quality over speed
- Podcast launch: Within 8 weeks ideal, but can adjust
- System implementation: Iterative, adjust based on feedback

**Philosophy:** Better to implement systems correctly than quickly. Focus on adoption and usability over arbitrary deadlines.

**Timeline Review Cadence:** Weekly during Phases 1-3, then bi-weekly during Phase 4
**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025
**Next Review:** After goal-setting session with client
