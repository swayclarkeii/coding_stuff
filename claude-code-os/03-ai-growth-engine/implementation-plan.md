## Why Wait?

Strategy without data is just guessing. Right now you need:
- More clients (data points)
- Actual revenue (real numbers)
- Delivery experience (what works)

Once you have 2+ paying clients, you'll know:
- What clients actually value
- How long projects take
- What you can realistically charge

## Questions This Department Will Help Answer

- "How should I price my AI automation services?"
- "What's my ideal client profile?"
- "How do I scale without burning out?"
- "When should I hire help?"
- "What services should I add or drop?"
