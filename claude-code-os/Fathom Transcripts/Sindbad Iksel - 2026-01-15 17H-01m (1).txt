serious, they're so motivated, and I feel blessed to have a good team, a good bunch of individuals there, I have to say, that really care about what they do, and really take initiative, you know, you

moments that were a bit tricky, but one of the things that he like pushed me to do is give more responsibilities to people and like trust them more than I would naturally do, because I was maybe, you know, tend to be a little bit too kind of micromanaging a little bit.","timestamp":"00:24:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad

was telling you, one of the reasons we do all this calculation is like we motivate, like people basically get more money when there's more income.","timestamp":"00:24:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"It's like everyone is kind of, you know, yeah, like there's this real thing that I think we pay the people fairly, and anyway, it's nice to see, and they're great people, but yeah, so, and I think there's so many little things, so obviously the thing that worries me a little bit is if, because we've been so much sure of your time you've spent already, and if suddenly you come, you tell me it's going to cost something, and it's like way out of our budget, then, you know, it's going to be, I will have felt like I've wasted so much of your time, so this is why I wanted to get a bulk idea, you know, like a ballpark idea of what it may cost, and so that I can also come to, go to Pierre and say, listen, I think this will be super useful in the long run, not only is it going to save money, but it's going to make our team happier, and as you said, like, for example, Alice, she's great, like, she's wasting a lot of time doing all these things, and if she, I don't think what would happen is that if we kind of, if we saved her that, I don't think what would happen is that there","timestamp":"00:25:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"They would just, you know, do nothing.","timestamp":"00:26:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"I think they would, because they're so motivated, they would probably go and, like, spend more time, like, writing to a client, maybe pick up the phone, call them and say, you know, this overdue, because that's a big problem that we have, all these clients that don't pay the  invoice.","timestamp":"00:26:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"And I think this is something that they could have more time to address.","timestamp":"00:26:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"And, you know, I mean, it's also not fun, but it's very important that we get all that money.","timestamp":"00:26:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"And in other words, like, wait, all of this time spent doing these tasks, you know, maybe, like, we should address these, we shouldn't tolerate, like, people paying, like, four months later, six months later.","timestamp":"00:26:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"And I think we, because they're so caught up in the stuff, like, you know, anyway, it's just an example, the sort of things that they, yeah, it's a product, right?","timestamp":"00:26:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, you know, I think I've been thinking about it today.","timestamp":"00:26:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I kind of wonder if sometimes you can look with a system and you're like, the system creates the behavior in the people.","timestamp":"00:26:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or do the people create the behavior of the system?","timestamp":"00:27:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I think right now what's happening is because of the system, it's creating a behavior in the workers.","timestamp":"00:27:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because they end up having to do all of these tasks.","timestamp":"00:27:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So when they're like moving around and updating here and da-da-da-da-da-da, it creates the fact that they don't have a certain amount of time, the things that they have to prioritize, and then the things that they can kind of focus on.","timestamp":"00:27:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So it's kind of like because of the system, the way the system is, you're getting a certain type of productivity.","timestamp":"00:27:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You're getting a certain type of worker, right?","timestamp":"00:27:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"As opposed to like, okay, here are the people, let's build this system based on an individual, right?","timestamp":"00:27:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And it's fine, like Madalena said it, hey, I started this thing, we kind of just got it together, and every, you know, I was always building, I was always building, I was always building.","timestamp":"00:27:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But it was built in a certain way that was kind of like, okay, we got to get past this problem.","timestamp":"00:27:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So let's build this new thing to cover.","timestamp":"00:27:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And it's totally fine.","timestamp":"00:28:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I think the thing is, when you're talking about money, you're saying like, OK, I don't know how much it's going to cost.","timestamp":"00:28:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What is the system we're going to build?","timestamp":"00:28:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"OK, so the way that I usually work is this.","timestamp":"00:28:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Obviously, you can always go two ways.","timestamp":"00:28:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You can go based off of budget, or you can go based off of what we need to build.","timestamp":"00:28:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right.","timestamp":"00:28:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And budget is always a bit difficult when you're like, OK, this is this is how much I have.","timestamp":"00:28:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then what can we build based on that?","timestamp":"00:28:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But it is a restraint.","timestamp":"00:28:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It is a constraint.","timestamp":"00:28:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Then I think it's something to be addressed.","timestamp":"00:28:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

what it's going to be.","timestamp":"00:28:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's not the way I think about it.","timestamp":"00:28:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But what I need to do still is I need to kind of look at the way I kind of do it is lay out.","timestamp":"00:28:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Here are the possibilities.","timestamp":"00:29:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Here are the things we could build, and here are the things that will take very quick time, and this is the impact they'll have.","timestamp":"00:29:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

they'll have.","timestamp":"00:29:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And we can kind of, you know, if we do it in a way we build a roadmap that we start from here, and it's not something that we're like going to fix the whole system in a month or write it with the first build, but we build a roadmap that says, okay, in a year, or in six months, or in 12 months, or in, you know what I mean?","timestamp":"00:29:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"And we can also, if I understand properly as well, like pay you, not in installments, but we do first the tasks that we can afford.","timestamp":"00:29:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The way I work with, the way I like to work with clients is that it's not like I'm going to come in and say, hey, what do you want?","timestamp":"00:29:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Oh, you want a website?","timestamp":"00:29:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

efficiency.","timestamp":"00:30:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so whatever that starts with, you know, it could, I

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"want to take the transcripts, take the call and like go through it.","timestamp":"00:30:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Have you all like the three of you also give feedback on it?","timestamp":"00:30:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then we kind of, then I kind of got to look at, okay, if we're going to build this thing out, what is the potential cost for it?","timestamp":"00:30:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right?","timestamp":"00:30:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And we can decide like, Hey, you know what?","timestamp":"00:30:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"This is a really big project and we'd like to get there, but maybe we break it up into pieces.","timestamp":"00:30:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We break this big thing up into smaller pieces over time, and so it's a bit dynamic, and I think in your case, there's a lot of moving parts, you know, there's a lot of things that can happen, and you can very quickly be like, my job is really to kind of break this down to, okay, let's break this down to parts.","timestamp":"00:31:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If we implement this little thing here, what effect will that have, how long is that going to take, and how quickly can we do that, you know what I mean?","timestamp":"00:31:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

like talking to you, you know, because he's, I mean, it's also about the people, like, you know, if he appreciates you, it's going to help.","timestamp":"00:32:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad

have at the moment, and hopefully we won't have it anymore, but last year we made so many investments in terms of people, and then the, so our margin has gone down a lot, because one thing is the margin per project, but the amount of fixed people that we have has grown, meaning, and also there's the old AI thing, which is, you know, which means that Pierre and I have had like really two terrible months, which is fine, but it means, yeah, it's more","timestamp":"00:32:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad

think there is some money that we can spend immediately for sure, but it's going to be, it's just this moment where we're waiting to see if our clients are going to really not have a problem with the

of, let's say, little question marks in this, you know, because of the, you know, also this AI thing, because basically we've increased the price and we explain our clients, we increase the price because there's also this AI demand.","timestamp":"00:33:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"So, I am a little bit

the, you know, so it's all like, yeah, there's a few things, but anyway, I'm almost certain, you know, that we will one way or another use your services, I think, but I'm just a little bit, yeah, if it was going to be something where people are like, oh, I really can't afford it, like worse, worse, worse case scenario, was going to say, which really I hope it won't happen, but like, I would like to have, if Pia said, no, we can't afford it at the moment, blah, blah, blah, then, you know, at least pay you for all the time that you've spent because I feel like that, I feel just, yeah, a bit, like, no, I appreciate that, I appreciate that, I mean, I have to say, I'm a bit, I'm also a bit nervous of Pia, I don't know this person, and I don't know if he's going to be like the guy that shuts everything down, no, no, no, no, no, he's not at all, like, he's very, he's a very open-minded guy, but it's true that we, I think we both have been a little bit under pressure for the past two

honest.","timestamp":"00:35:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"mean, I think you haven't seen, because you've seen

things.","timestamp":"00:35:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I think we should rope Pierre in as soon as we can, as soon

this.","timestamp":"00:36:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Um, I'm trying to think about this in terms of time wise,

I don't think he's going to shut anything down, let's do the call with him, I think it's a great idea, and then if by the worst possible scenario, for some reason, like there was no, outcome, I would want to somehow compensate you for all the time, because I, yeah, that's all I wanted to say, you know, just because I, you never know, right, like, you know, if we have a really , oh, oh, it might

more, and you know, we threaten, we've put stuff in place, you know, threaten, you know, then we send the invoice about like, cause you know, you have, there's a limit to how much you can charge, you

could tighten up, like the AI thing, really, I think that unchecked, this can get very out of control.","timestamp":"00:45:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

of, if we put too much regulation on them, we're going to lose them as a customer, because they're already increasing the money, right, and I think the other side of it is also, if you guys do that great of a job, people know, yo, I'm not going to find the service and the complete service anywhere else, right, and so I just kind of have to deal with what it is,","timestamp":"00:45:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because it's a bit of a bluffing game, but I really do believe,

right.","timestamp":"00:46:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The thing that what it does is it just psychologically puts

ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"The client, because the one thing, sorry, and I, yeah, if it's the client, they might, the problem with that is that they might be, no, no, no, for this project, we don't need the IRO.","timestamp":"00:47:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"And then in the middle of the, this is the problem because the client is like, no, no, no, let's not pay.","timestamp":"00:47:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"Because then they would be like, just take it out.","timestamp":"00:47:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"If it's so much, take it out.","timestamp":"00:47:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"Because there's a way to build the treatment with Without the, you know, without AI.","timestamp":"00:47:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"But then in the middle, of course, the suddenly, because that's the thing, like, what sometimes AI saves can save two hours to visual researcher, because instead of researching the image that he needs, he's gonna just create it.","timestamp":"00:47:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"And so he can't save us time.","timestamp":"00:47:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"So it's this weird thing is, it's a little bit tricky, because at the same, you want to charge the client, because we've thought about it, you know, like, giving it as an option.","timestamp":"00:47:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"And maybe it's an option that as soon as they get asked for one generation, then And","timestamp":"00:47:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"They have to start paying that extra bit, but I mean, the other thing is to, I don't know, sorry, if that's what you, because I wasn't sure if you put the risk on the client, or the only thing you could do is put it on the, because it's the visual researcher that also does the generations and say, here's your budget, don't go over these credits, because otherwise we'll take it off your pace.","timestamp":"00:48:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"It's a bit mean, but it's another way of doing it, right?","timestamp":"00:48:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Visual researcher is your person, and the problem with this is that I think the visual researcher also doesn't have much power in this whole scenario, like their power level versus the producer, production company versus the director is probably pretty small, right, and so I think that the reason, it's not even transferring, it's spreading the risk, you're going to always have a risk that with any project, you're going to pay, let's just take an arbitrary number of 500 euros, that's how much we're going to pay.","timestamp":"00:48:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If you guys go over that, then you.","timestamp":"00:48:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You pay.","timestamp":"00:49:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The production company, you will have to pay that difference, and we'll just put it onto your bill.","timestamp":"00:49:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"The risk always is, and this is where it gets so, sorry, I don't want to be, because I agree generally, but the problem is like they could go and say, listen, like, that was really, you did a bad job on this.","timestamp":"00:49:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"So, of course, you're spending more because you don't

mean?","timestamp":"00:49:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad ambushed.tv","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"sindbad@ambushed.tv"},"text":"Like, it could be.","timestamp":"00:49:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yes, and I think this is where, but this is where the risk, this is where it comes back to you as a company that's saying, if we're going to offer this service, we got to make sure we're offering the service and we're tight about it.","timestamp":"00:49:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"sindbad

no.","timestamp":"00:49:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So this guy knows exactly what he's doing when it comes to

do.","timestamp":"00:49:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"This has to do with the fact that you've changed your mind 7,000 times and you have no direction.","timestamp":"00:50:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So you have to be able to

at what you've used in the last couple of months and look at the credits used, be able to compute it, and you can then say, okay, if we get a million credits a month, we more than cover the costs.","timestamp":"00:53:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then you can say to every project, you look, I mean,
