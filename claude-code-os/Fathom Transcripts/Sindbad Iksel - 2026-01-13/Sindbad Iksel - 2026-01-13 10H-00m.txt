Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And you had a lot of these early people that wanted to be in Berlin to create something.","timestamp":"00:03:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"know, Laue was a big artist that was here for a

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But over time, a lot of the other Germans, as I would say, the Germans from Munich, the Germans","timestamp":"00:03:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The from Stuttgart, the Germans from Hamburg and Frankfurt, the ones that all had money, them and their parents were like, well, Berlin's cheap, let's go buy some houses, let me go buy you an apartment in Berlin.","timestamp":"00:03:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so you started to have all of these, they call them Spiesik, these people that are, like, they don't really have style, there are a lot of suburbs, you know, they come here and they just, they want to be here because they think it's cool, but my take is they're not contributing.","timestamp":"00:04:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They're not, they're not bringing the culture here, they're just kind of taking the culture, taking up space.","timestamp":"00:04:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And it's cool.","timestamp":"00:04:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, it's what tourists do, I guess, but then they started buying up large swaths of the area and it started changing.","timestamp":"00:04:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And a lot of the artists and people left, a lot of the DJs have been leaving, a lot of the artists have been leaving, rents going up, you know, and you just have these, it's just not Berlin anymore, you know.","timestamp":"00:04:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I think that's, yeah, it's a sort of story as old as time, we have the same in London, where it's like, everyone moves to Shoreditch because it's like, it's super cheap.","timestamp":"00:04:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And then like, all the sort of yuppies come in like, oh, let's.","timestamp":"00:04:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So then everyone goes to Brixton, then they follow them to Brixton, so everyone leaves for Bristol, and then the Bristol prices go through the roof, and then people are in Froome or Margate, but then they become so prohibitively expensive as well, it's just a sort of weird dance, isn't it, where it's like you find a cool spot, and then everyone's like, oh, there's a cool spot, and they all sort of jump in on it.","timestamp":"00:05:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's exactly that, right, and Berlin is losing its vibe, so to speak.","timestamp":"00:05:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Where's the next cool place, do you think?","timestamp":"00:05:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Well, I mean, a lot of people are kind of, I think the next move are people going a bit more siloed, like I think people are going to smaller towns, like smaller areas, smaller towns, I think this movement and this generation is now like, I'm getting out of the city, I'm moving to a place where I can access the city, but I can also access nature, and I think other places, like cities, we're talking about like Accra, you know, in Ghana, and places like this that are now the next city, Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think, I think my take is your","timestamp":"00:05:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Europe's kind of done, like there's no real where to go unless you want to go to East Europe, like people are going to Albania, sorry, people are going to Georgia, places like this, but only certain people are going there, because I'm like, I'm not moving to Georgia, I mean, I'm a black dude, I'm not moving my kids to Georgia, right, you know what mean, so there's only certain places, certain people will go, and I think the next places will be, you know, like Mexico, a lot of people are moving to Mexico, a lot of people are moving to West Africa now, you know, places like Cairo, I think it's going to change, I think it's going to change, I think it's going to change, I think it's I think in Europe people are moving to, like out of the city, you can see a lot of groups that are like, hey, let's just go buy some land with a bunch of friends and a bunch of families, buying the land, and then, you know, moving out to these places, because you can do everything remotely now, right, I mean, so why do I need to pay exorbitant amounts of money for these rental apartments, right, so, and anyway, I","timestamp":"00:06:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Anyways, could talk forever.","timestamp":"00:07:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Sindbad and I, we can chat forever.","timestamp":"00:07:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, well, nice.","timestamp":"00:07:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Just to let you know, Sway, I've had a bit of a rough, I didn't see very well, so I'm going to let Richard do most of the talking, and I have got a few things I might add, but I'm not feeling super well.","timestamp":"00:07:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"No worries, no worries.","timestamp":"00:07:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No worries at all, man.","timestamp":"00:07:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So yeah, we just really want to hear a little bit more about Aloksa, really, and how we could potentially benefit.","timestamp":"00:07:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, well, I mean, I'd like to hear a bit more about you.","timestamp":"00:07:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's actually the thing.","timestamp":"00:07:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So I think I'll tell you about what I do.","timestamp":"00:07:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What I do is, Aloksa is basically a company that helps, I call it like an AI transformation partner, essentially.","timestamp":"00:07:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what we do is we work with small businesses, solo entrepreneurs, and helping them essentially get ready for the transformation of getting into automation or getting into AI or getting into systems, right?","timestamp":"00:07:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because right now we have a lot of classic systems, you know, you have a lot of things that you're cutting and pasting and you're putting it over here and you're doing this.","timestamp":"00:07:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And while we're moving forward, you have to fix a lot of these systems before you can do any kind of automation, before you can do any kind of AI, before you can implement these things, you have to fix your systems.","timestamp":"00:08:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So a lot of businesses I help really look at their systems and see how their systems are working and see if they're fixable, so to speak.","timestamp":"00:08:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Some of the systems need to be replaced, some of them need to be enhanced, some of them need to be changed.","timestamp":"00:08:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then the last step is, okay, well, now that we've figured out how this system runs, let's see how we can make it faster, let's see how we can make it more efficient, let's see how we can save time, and let's see how it can make you more money.","timestamp":"00:08:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's essentially what it is.","timestamp":"00:08:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Save time, make you money.","timestamp":"00:08:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But it really all comes down to systems, right?","timestamp":"00:08:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what I want to do in order to give you any value from the call, I kind of would love to understand a few things.","timestamp":"00:08:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I've got a few questions that I would love to, I'm going to be writing as well, but I've got a few questions I'd love to get, but the real...","timestamp":"00:08:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The real deal is kind of understanding what your processes are, like what your system looked like, what's your day look like, what are you doing, how are you guys working together in terms of sales?","timestamp":"00:09:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You know, we talked a bit about kind of the leads and lead generation.","timestamp":"00:09:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I think just to, I kind of, this is my coaching thing I'll say here, is that I don't know if you've ever heard of Lean.","timestamp":"00:09:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Have you guys ever heard of Lean Systems?","timestamp":"00:09:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, Lean Management essentially is a system created from Toyota many, many years ago that was adopted by a lot of Western companies.","timestamp":"00:09:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And what it does, why it's amazing is what it does, it looks at problems.","timestamp":"00:09:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's all it does.","timestamp":"00:09:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It always looks at a problem and says, OK, we're going to fix the problem.","timestamp":"00:09:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then for that, we're going to look at another problem and then fix the problem.","timestamp":"00:09:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And essentially, you get to a

becomes hard in Western world.","timestamp":"00:09:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's because most people don't want to look at problems.","timestamp":"00:10:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They want to appease.","timestamp":"00:10:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They want to tell them, just give me the solution.","timestamp":"00:10:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Tell me when the problem's done.","timestamp":"00:10:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I don't want to hear about the problems.","timestamp":"00:10:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so it's a different take at looking at this.","timestamp":"00:10:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I bring this up because you guys have a dynamic, right?","timestamp":"00:10:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"There's partnership or boss or, you know, whatever that dynamic is.","timestamp":"00:10:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But, and I don't want this call to be an interrogation

producing?","timestamp":"00:10:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's not the point of the call.","timestamp":"00:10:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The real point is to like, let's all look at the system.","timestamp":"00:10:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Just look at the system and like, look at the problems.","timestamp":"00:10:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And if there are problems, the best thing is to point them out, to be able to make them, make aware of the problems so that we can fix them.","timestamp":"00:10:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Richard, just so you know, like during the first call, I thought about, you know, things that I had problems with and I've shared my screen and showed my, so I don't know if I told you that before.","timestamp":"00:10:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And if I haven't, sorry, the idea would be to really see, yeah, how you've been,","timestamp":"00:10:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"For example, I know you've been taking some names of producers' details from IMDB, maybe that's something that, you know, that could be automated, for example, I don't know.","timestamp":"00:11:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah, I mean, I would say from my point of view, we have an absolutely fantastic product.","timestamp":"00:11:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"We like 99% of our customers are blown away by what we can do.","timestamp":"00:11:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And I think we do have sort of the infrastructure for more volume, and it's just finding a time-effective and efficient way of reaching out to a client base.","timestamp":"00:11:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And I'm doing as best I can, sort of just basically getting any sort of contact details I can, just harvesting them off the web and sending sort of semi-stock.","timestamp":"00:11:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Some of them I try and personalise if I, if I know something about the production company or the producer, but in general, a sort of stock email out just to sort of link to our website, tell them what we do, and, but I'm not going to...","timestamp":"00:11:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"It hasn't been, like, hugely fruitful as of yet, and I would, yeah, obviously love any advice or anything that, yeah, you can think of that's going to make that job more, yeah, more fruitful.","timestamp":"00:12:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Well, I'd like to look at, you know, let's start with what does a day look like?","timestamp":"00:12:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What does a week look like?","timestamp":"00:12:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What does a day look like?","timestamp":"00:12:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"In famous way, sorry, just to be, the deal we have with Richard at the moment, because the company doesn't generate a lot of money, is that he's not, like, he's a screenwriter, he's not, like, first of all, he's not a full-time job, like, he's, I don't know how many hours he does, sometimes I think he does more than he should, because, you know, the pay is not great at the moment, where he gets more, because he's a writer, on a lot of projects he works as a writer, then he gets paid, you know, much more decently, but yeah, so in other words, don't expect, it's not like you're speaking to a person that only does that full-time, you know, he, he, yeah, no, I try and put, I try and put it apart, like, a couple of hours a day.","timestamp":"00:12:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"For boldmove, sometimes it'll be a really busy day, and I'll do five or six, and sometimes there's not a huge amount to do, or I've got other, because obviously I have to have other side hustles going on, but I mean, the reason that I'm so passionate about boldmove is, well, A, because, you know, I love what we do, but B, I think if I put the time and the effort in now, then when things do pick up, then obviously, like, we'll be able to discuss, like, probably a slightly better sort of financial situation for me, so that's, you know.","timestamp":"00:13:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what's your, I mean, no, I totally get that you're part-time, I totally understand it, and I know that time is restrictive.","timestamp":"00:13:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I think for me to understand is what, when you are, when you do it at time, what are you doing?","timestamp":"00:13:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"How does it work?","timestamp":"00:13:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, what is your current system, so to speak?","timestamp":"00:13:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah, so first of all, no, it's fine, so my first port of calls was admin, so like, I'll check invoices, I'll make sure, for example, that the dashboard, so the dashboard is where all the sort of projects live, and we can see where we're at, that's all updated.","timestamp":"00:13:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And the project directories all working fine.","timestamp":"00:14:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"That's very similar.","timestamp":"00:14:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"We kind of copied what we had at Ambush, so it's kind of the same thing.","timestamp":"00:14:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Okay, so you have a dashboard.","timestamp":"00:14:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"We're going to have a call tomorrow with the three ladies who are, but they know how to use, you know, I've shared that with my screen, I think, last time.","timestamp":"00:14:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Is it the same dashboard?","timestamp":"00:14:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"The list of, it's an Excel, and we just put projects and like, you know, how much they pay, sorry, you know, how much we agreed on.","timestamp":"00:14:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And then we put all the, all the, what the people charged us.","timestamp":"00:14:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And so then we get like, you know, a margin on each project, and then we can do a calculation of the margin over all of the projects, you know, for a month.","timestamp":"00:14:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So that's what, yeah, that's what the dashboard is really.","timestamp":"00:14:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"That's what we call the dashboard, yeah.","timestamp":"00:14:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay, so dashboard, just so I understand, I'll ask a few questions while you're talking, Richard.","timestamp":"00:14:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But the dashboard is essentially your source of truth that says, these are the.","timestamp":"00:14:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The.","timestamp":"00:14:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Richard talking because he also helps out a little bit with admin, so I think let's just focus, Richard, on the sales part.","timestamp":"00:15:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Ah, okay, now I get it.","timestamp":"00:15:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay, so let me be more specific.","timestamp":"00:15:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We'll see that tomorrow.","timestamp":"00:15:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"If there's anything that we do that's useful at Ambush that we want to bring, the thing is, because the volumes are so much lower, think the dashboard doesn't take, Richard, much time to do.","timestamp":"00:15:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So I think today, let's really focus only on the sales part.","timestamp":"00:15:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So just lead, we're going to focus on leads, like what is your process with leads, how are you finding leads, where are they coming from, how many of them, you know what I mean?","timestamp":"00:15:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like this is what we're going to focus on.","timestamp":"00:15:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So I think for the first couple of months, I primarily reached out to sort of producers, so I would go on IMDB, I would usually use ChatGPT.","timestamp":"00:15:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So I'd type in like, you know, ChatGPT, give me the top 30 up and coming producers in America.","timestamp":"00:15:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And… … … … … … … …","timestamp":"00:15:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"That would come up with a list, and then I'd use IMDB just to hopefully get contact details from them, but if I couldn't do that, then I'd have to do a bit of a Google web search and get into their website and try and find contact details there.","timestamp":"00:16:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So I built a sort of database of, I think, something around 150 to 200.","timestamp":"00:16:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah, I've actually got it right here.","timestamp":"00:16:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So, yeah, so 173 producers.","timestamp":"00:16:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So I contacted them under the, this is where it's going to get a little bit confusing because I do my admin duties through Alice, who is the previous admin person.","timestamp":"00:16:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"We didn't want to make it basically look like the same guy who was like writing the copy was also like chasing sales.","timestamp":"00:16:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"You know, I mean, it just felt a little bit like, well, it's just like a one man band where I'm just banging all the drums and doing cymbals.","timestamp":"00:16:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So, so I reached out to that under Alice's thing and I'm now going through the process of following those up with a sort of like, hey, my colleague Alice got in touch with you.","timestamp":"00:16:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So, Thank","timestamp":"00:16:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Two or three months ago, to draw your attention to boldmove, you know, our slate's filling up really quickly for 2026, so like, if you want to jump on a call, we'd love to hear from you, but then I got sort of sidetracked by, I was having a meeting with someone, and they said, you know, the people you should really be going out to is sales agents, because they're actually the ones that have got a budget for this stuff, they're the ones that are like, they've got, you know, you know, it's a marketing sort of industry sales agents.","timestamp":"00:17:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So then I took a bit of a swerve, and then started reaching out to sales agents too.","timestamp":"00:17:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What type of, there are sales agents, particularly in the film business?","timestamp":"00:17:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally, yeah.","timestamp":"00:17:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And just so I'm going to ask some questions while we go along, so you went and found these 175, roughly, producers, just offline, you went and scoured them using ChatGPT, and then you tried to connect their contact information with the information you had using IMDB or wherever.","timestamp":"00:17:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Exactly.","timestamp":"00:17:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So you put one, like a name in, then you typed it, typed up the email, and then at some point you started cutting and pasting.","timestamp":"00:18:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay, boom, boom, cut, paste, cut, paste, cut, paste.","timestamp":"00:18:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Okay, okay.","timestamp":"00:18:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So yeah, I would approach Sindbad just to make sure he was signed off on the emails, because obviously once you start sending them, you know, if there's somebody, you know, Sindbad doesn't like, then that's not going to work.","timestamp":"00:18:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So I would get Sindbad to sign up on them all, and then once he was okay with that, I would literally just be like, yeah, cut, paste, cut, paste, cut, paste, cut, paste.","timestamp":"00:18:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And that would be my story.","timestamp":"00:18:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"When I do it myself, honestly, Sway, it's like, I don't know about you, but like, I always question, should I phrase this differently?","timestamp":"00:18:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"You know, when you don't get answers, you're like, oh, starting to really question, you know, how it's phrased, it's a tough one.","timestamp":"00:18:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But I, and I know that when I do this, that very regularly, I like, I try to change with the wording in the hope that it's going to make a difference.","timestamp":"00:18:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:18:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"It's, no, not that.","timestamp":"00:18:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"It's a tough one because I guess that's not, yeah, that's not Sway's expertise really, but I guess it's more, I don't know, I, yeah, sorry.","timestamp":"00:19:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Just an aside, because I mean, there is a place where my expertise ends, right, obviously, and part of the goal of this call is to find out whether I can help you or not, right?","timestamp":"00:19:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's, that's also from my end of it, right?","timestamp":"00:19:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because I'm not coming in as like a sales expert to say, let's train you as a sales expert, you know what mean?","timestamp":"00:19:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"However, I will mention, you should check out a book, it's a quick read, check out $100 Million Leads by Alex Formozzi.","timestamp":"00:19:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"$100 Million Leads.","timestamp":"00:19:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, $100 Million Leads.","timestamp":"00:19:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"He's, he's an incredible marketer and sales, sales, dude, that's, he's, he's also a very huge influencer.","timestamp":"00:19:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But he's got a series of books, $100 Million, $100 Million Leads.","timestamp":"00:19:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Offer, $100 million leads, and they're really, really good.","timestamp":"00:20:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"He's a normalized dude.","timestamp":"00:20:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"started like gyms like back in the day and has built up, I don't know, $100 million companies in the past several years.","timestamp":"00:20:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But what he does very well is he breaks down how to communicate your offer and how to communicate to leads.","timestamp":"00:20:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's very, very simple the way he kind of breaks it down.","timestamp":"00:20:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You know, you make sure you have your ask, you make sure if you're reaching out, you kind of.","timestamp":"00:20:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The one thing I will say is a lot of times what happens with non-quality, like you don't get responses, unfortunately, because these emails look like cut and paste.","timestamp":"00:20:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So you kind of have to look sometimes for like the quality versus the quantity, right?","timestamp":"00:20:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like if you're looking at 100 people, then it just makes more sense to like uniquely do 100 emails, really.","timestamp":"00:20:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But if you're looking at 10,000 emails, that's when you're looking at like cut and paste, cut and paste, because you're looking at volume.","timestamp":"00:20:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So one of the questions you have to ask.","timestamp":"00:20:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Ask yourself as going out with leads, are we looking for volume?","timestamp":"00:21:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Are we looking for quality?","timestamp":"00:21:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because quantity or quality?","timestamp":"00:21:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because you're always looking at volume, because my next question is from the 175, you know, we'll get to that.","timestamp":"00:21:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"How many people actually responded?","timestamp":"00:21:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, what's the conversion

Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"We've got these.","timestamp":"00:30:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I did like a one hour call with all of these five German women and they seemed super interested.","timestamp":"00:30:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And then nothing came of it, which is weird because they were like every time I put the deck up, .","timestamp":"00:30:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"You know, were so, you know, um, yeah, seemed to be really.","timestamp":"00:30:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Excited.","timestamp":"00:31:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So this is just a small direct.","timestamp":"00:31:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I don't think it's going to be something any big is going to come out of it, but yeah, so there's about what?","timestamp":"00:31:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, 15 that are, you know, let's say slightly warmer.","timestamp":"00:31:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And then these are just people I had approached, but they didn't seem to be hugely interested.","timestamp":"00:31:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"This is, yeah, like she introduced us to someone so she knows about us.","timestamp":"00:31:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So yeah, anyway, I think in this list, there's about 30 to 40.","timestamp":"00:31:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And in this list, there's about, yeah, 20.","timestamp":"00:31:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So, you know, probably a total of 50 or something.","timestamp":"00:31:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:31:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And this, so these, these, okay, so it's not a huge amount.","timestamp":"00:31:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"No, no, no, because most of the time when people get in touch, a lot of the time we, we just do business, right?","timestamp":"00:31:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I mean, because basically we've got the huge chance of, I had a.","timestamp":"00:31:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I had with my business partner at Ambush, because it doesn't work the same way, like the timelines at Ambush are very short, like we make projects in three or four days, and the projects always have the same kind of structure, you know, have a team of two with a person overseeing, and like it's kind of, we really package the thing.","timestamp":"00:32:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"For bold movies, you know, sometimes it can last for weeks, you know, which is actually quite annoying, sometimes like a month, project could be a month, you know, but with days kind of scattered, you know, it's not ideal actually.","timestamp":"00:32:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Anyway, the point is, we can't really deal with those projects at Ambush, and this is why I had created a separate department, and then we decided that it's going to be, so yeah, so then we kind of split that.","timestamp":"00:32:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Now, you know, but, because we built such a strong reputation at Ambush, we regularly get people coming to Ambush saying, hey, I've got a project, a fiction project, and then we say, oh yeah, we can't do it, but boldmove does it, and we're using the same.","timestamp":"00:32:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"guess not","timestamp":"00:32:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Ah, can move your seats over.","timestamp":"00:33:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"95% of our clients come through that channel.","timestamp":"00:33:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So that's your strongest sales funnel.","timestamp":"00:33:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right now, it's actually Ambush, and then, oh, we've got this other company that does this thing over here.","timestamp":"00:33:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so I understand you're wanting to create a new funnel.","timestamp":"00:33:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You wanted to create a new sales funnel.","timestamp":"00:33:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, exactly.","timestamp":"00:33:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Because I think that's just, you know, yeah, we can't just rely on that.","timestamp":"00:33:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And it's not enough.","timestamp":"00:33:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Like, I mean, I think I was telling you, Sway, I mean, I think we, I mean, we have between, we have months where we have literally zero projects.","timestamp":"00:33:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But normally, there's always something going on.","timestamp":"00:33:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But let's say between one, a very good month is going be seven.","timestamp":"00:33:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And it's just, yeah, it's just not enough.","timestamp":"00:33:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Like, we need to, I think, to be comfortable, we would need to average about 20 projects a month.","timestamp":"00:33:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"You know, I mean, 15 would be already pretty good.","timestamp":"00:33:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Also, the projects a month.","timestamp":"00:33:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Sorry?","timestamp":"00:33:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"For bold move.","timestamp":"00:33:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Bold move.","timestamp":"00:33:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"That would be good, yeah.","timestamp":"00:34:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"currently, I think the average, I would say, is maybe three, four.","timestamp":"00:34:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah, something like that.","timestamp":"00:34:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And also, what is slightly concerning is the – I think we're being underpaid, to be honest, because we're always being fought down.","timestamp":"00:34:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So ideally, we want to be getting, as a bare minimum, between €3,000 and €5,000 a deck, right, Sindbad?","timestamp":"00:34:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:34:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But, like, we're constantly being pushed down and down and down and down.","timestamp":"00:34:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And we've done decks for, like, 1,200.","timestamp":"00:34:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"mean, admittedly, they've been relatively elementary and haven't had the sort of cool quirks that boldmove are capable of.","timestamp":"00:34:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But it's also, like, trying to explain to the client just, like, that there is such value in what we do, but you have to, sort of, pay us a fair rate, because we just always feel that, like, they're just trying to, like, take that other, you know, that €200, just squeeze it out of us.","timestamp":"00:34:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And I don't know if I told you, Swayte, like, what – I mean, we're going","timestamp":"00:34:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Meet, actually, in January with Richard and this guy called Alesh, who's in Madrid, and I really think, I know, again, this is sales stuff, sorry, because I know we're not talking about your core expertise, but I think we're going to create packages in that way, and that works for Ambush.","timestamp":"00:35:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So it's like, okay, there's a $3,000 package, there's a $4,000 package, there's a $5,000 package, and, you know, that way they know, they know what they can have with it, and then maybe at some point they don't have that money, but the they do have the money, they're coming and they're prepared to pay $3, $4, $5, rather than someone who comes hoping to pay $1,000, and then they're being told it's like $3,000, and then they're like, uh, Yeah, yeah, yeah, is interesting, right, because I think, I mean, of 175 leads, 20, roughly of 20 are responding, and of all that, there's zero closing, it really says, well,","timestamp":"00:35:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Well, there are leads, you you found leads and there are responses, people, you know, 20, 20 people did respond, right?","timestamp":"00:36:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So you're looking at a little over 10%, but there's no conversion, which means there may be something wrong with the offer, right?","timestamp":"00:36:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"There may be something wrong with like the perceived value that they're going to get or not get from this because it isn't like you had 175 and then nobody responded, right?","timestamp":"00:36:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so there's a couple of things that I think to look at, which is A, how do you get more leads, right?","timestamp":"00:36:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because my question would be, you said you want to start out with producers and then you're targeting sales agents.","timestamp":"00:36:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So was there any difference between targeting the producers and the sales agents in terms of the quality of the lead?","timestamp":"00:36:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So producers often had a personalized email, which was so much better.","timestamp":"00:36:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So if you've got John at...","timestamp":"00:36:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Imaginepictures.com, that's such obviously a better lead than quite often with the sales agents, I'm emailing like info at, do you know what mean?","timestamp":"00:37:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And it's just like, I feel that like, if you're going into the info at, the admin at, you know, I just feel that's, do you know what mean?","timestamp":"00:37:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"You're throwing yourself in with all the people that want to send screenplays and want to, do know what mean?","timestamp":"00:37:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"It's not necessarily as strong a lead as if you've got a name and you can put a name on the top of that email and say, hey, Mike, nice to meet you.","timestamp":"00:37:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I'm Richard from boldmove sort of thing.","timestamp":"00:37:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what was the, but, but of the, of the responses, like, did you get any responses from the sales agents that you, you reached out to?","timestamp":"00:37:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Again, like, you know, sort of lukewarm sort of lead, you know, sort of, oh, you know, we might have things in the future.","timestamp":"00:37:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I mean, to be fair, I was doing a lot of this sort of late November, December time.","timestamp":"00:37:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And I do feel like the industry, like from halfway through November, everyone just seems to want to get the, you know, get Christmas on the go.","timestamp":"00:37:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So, so obviously January, I really want to hit the ground running.","timestamp":"00:37:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And I will be, like, following up on all of that.","timestamp":"00:38:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"just curious, sorry, Sway, Richard, you started, right, with the emails from you as Richard saying, oh, you've received the email from Alice.","timestamp":"00:38:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Do people react to that?","timestamp":"00:38:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yes.","timestamp":"00:38:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So we've had, yeah, we've had sort of three or four back already since I started a week and a day ago.","timestamp":"00:38:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And also, I think what's helped as well is the website has now got some of our more current, newer decks on them as well.","timestamp":"00:38:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So I think that's how things file.","timestamp":"00:38:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"What kind of responses?","timestamp":"00:38:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Sorry, because I don't want to waste your time, Sway, but how did they respond?","timestamp":"00:38:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Like, was it a little bit more enthusiastic?","timestamp":"00:38:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Was it more, like, did it seem like you might get closer to actually have a call with them or?","timestamp":"00:38:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I mean, again, just like incredibly sort of complimentary and sort of like, you know, but all sort of, I guess, like pushing to a future date where they would be interested in working with us.","timestamp":"00:38:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Never sort of like, oh, wow, I've got this project now.","timestamp":"00:38:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"This is the thing, Sway, it's like, yeah, like, I mean.","timestamp":"00:38:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I think it depends on the producers, but, you know, maybe this is why advertising was so much quicker because if you're an advertising film production company, you're going to want to make, I don't know, like five, ten pitch decks per month.","timestamp":"00:39:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Like that's heavy.","timestamp":"00:39:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"That's a lot of stuff that you've got to do.","timestamp":"00:39:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"With film and TV, you know, maybe you're going to do two or three or four, and maybe you're going to have one out of all of those projects that you really want to push and you're going to invest a little bit more for it.","timestamp":"00:39:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So in other words, it's not completely abnormal, right, that it's that they don't straight away, you know, be like, oh, yeah, I've got something, you know, that you mean, it's the urgency behind it.","timestamp":"00:39:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Sorry, what I mean.","timestamp":"00:39:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So with with with advertising, there's the urgency.","timestamp":"00:39:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So with the advertising, I had this crazy thing because people say, oh, when I tried because I did the leads, you know, stuff at the beginning of ambush.","timestamp":"00:39:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And now and people said, oh, yeah, if you have, you know, 10 percent answer and then one.","timestamp":"00:39:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I would get 20% answers, but like these guys wanted to do business, like literally, like I would get, you know, 10% of my emails would turn into a project, that was really, really good, even maybe 15%, like literally turning a concrete project, but I think it's just because they, yeah, they didn't have a lot of people, I think it's just a harder, which is, to be honest, my, and maybe I'm wrong, but like we had this kind of super elaborate, to be fair, strategy on LinkedIn, because I've contacted a ton of people on LinkedIn, and they excel very easily, you know, especially because now I know a lot of, because I've got a bigger number of people on LinkedIn, if someone comes to you and they say, oh yeah, you know, they've got, they're friends with 100 people that I'm friends with, then, you know, anyway, it's quite easy to create connections on LinkedIn.","timestamp":"00:40:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"The idea that we had, and it's a bit, it's been a bit tough, but we wanted to make proof decks, so can,","timestamp":"00:40:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"We of come up with like a crazy idea for a film that will never exist, and like make it, make a really funny, like take piss, sorry, of like for example, you know, murder mysteries, like you always have these like stupid murder mysteries, you know, where you, you know, it's like kind of vaguely comedy, but it's just a bit, I don't know, I feel like it's getting a little bit old, like that genre, like they're really pushing, it's kind of hammy, so we thought, oh, we could make a real like hilarious, like deck about, you know, a murder mystery that, that doesn't exist, but that was a lot of work, so we, we were like, you know, the writing was bang on, but then we realized like through do, actually building the deck, doing the animations, et cetera, making the funny come through, like it was really hard, so anyway, the point is, it's still something, but, but what I wanted is instead of, you know, because a lot of people say, oh, go on LinkedIn, write, you know, advice for the industry or whatever, you know, which is totally fair, like,","timestamp":"00:41:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"It could work, but I thought it'd be quite nice for Arlington to be so different, it's literally like a comedy, but we're showing our skills, you know, and then you expect, oh yeah, every month there's one coming out, oh look, did you see the next, the new boldmove, like a crazy day, you know, so I still think it's a great strategy, and we'd have fun with it, like we kind of blocked in the process of the first one, but I don't know, I just think thinking outside the box is probably not a bad idea, you know, but yeah, I don't know, sorry.","timestamp":"00:42:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, no, no, not at all, not at all, you know, I mean, I think that my question, like my question's also coming into this call, where is this a strategy issue, or is this a system issue, right, and that's the big question that we're kind of talking about at the moment, right, because I think that there needs to be a strategy for who you're targeting, why you're targeting, how you're targeting, right, and so if you're finding like","timestamp":"00:42:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Producers are the ones giving you the most responses, then how do we best target producers, and how do we get beyond 175 producers, like are there more producers, know, is it a big pool, is it not a big pool, right, those are all the questions that kind of need to be answered, and also, is there another target outside of producers, right, you see, you went to sales agents, but didn't seem to really pan out, right, and maybe, maybe it's not the best, right, what's the learning from that, right, and it's also, I think, what's the, is there, I was thinking, what, is there any way for you to get feedback from people that didn't take the offer, right, because it would be good to find out why they didn't take the offer, right, even if it's quick, five questions, hey, look, I know that you didn't take the offer, but we're trying to fix the product for 2026, hey, if you just give me some feedback, you know, I don't know, we'll give you a discount on the next, I don't know, whatever, right, but some people will just do it out of, just do","timestamp":"00:43:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And it might be good to find out, is it the price, is it the offer, is it something they need, are they not, you know what I mean, the perception of it, maybe they don't understand it, who knows, right, but that might be the best way, if you have a contact list, maybe the best way is just ask them with the feedback, you know.","timestamp":"00:44:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"What I can tell you, Sway, which is why, you know, we are kind of pumped, even though we're really, yeah, I don't think we're doing this as well as we could, but, and this is super good advice, thank you so much, I was going to say, where we, I'll give you an example, like, we had a client come, they were like, ooh, it's a bit pricey, can we make it under $2,000, and so we made the first deck under $2,000, $1,800 or something, they were so over the moon, next project, you know, $3.5, right, no problem, like, you know what mean, it depends, because they've realized that the excitement, same company, mean, after that, bump the price up, same company, well, because we gave them a huge discount, so,","timestamp":"00:44:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And on the next one, they were like, yeah, we understand that you're doing great work, so we're like, yeah.","timestamp":"00:45:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And maybe this is interesting.","timestamp":"00:45:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Maybe that's a way you can say, okay, let's go for a feedback strategy.","timestamp":"00:45:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We actually go back to all of these people.","timestamp":"00:45:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We ask them, hey, can you take five minutes?","timestamp":"00:45:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And if so, we'll give you 30% off your first pitch deck from boldmoves, knowing, because you know once they get this, they're not going to go anywhere else.","timestamp":"00:45:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then maybe it's a long-term play, because they're going to need another pitch deck in a couple of months, right?","timestamp":"00:45:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So maybe that's a strategy for your in, and you kind of use it as a feedback, you know?","timestamp":"00:45:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"It might be.","timestamp":"00:45:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"It might be a way to look at it.","timestamp":"00:45:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"That's a really good shout, man.","timestamp":"00:45:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:45:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And the other part of it, I mean, like, you know, I would always admit where I can help and where I can't help, right?","timestamp":"00:45:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I think at the end of the day, thus far, mean, Sinbad and I have become, I don't in a way, fast friends.","timestamp":"00:45:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So I'm...","timestamp":"00:45:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'm to help, right?","timestamp":"00:46:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's not about like, I need to get the deal.","timestamp":"00:46:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I just want to help you guys out.","timestamp":"00:46:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And if I can help you out with advice or actually building something great, but it doesn't have to be both.","timestamp":"00:46:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so where I would kind of come in is like, if you had a target audience, if you had a target, like, this is what we want to get to, but we don't know, we need to get to more of them.","timestamp":"00:46:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You know what I mean?","timestamp":"00:46:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We have a target audience, but I only have a certain amount of time in a day and I have a bandwidth.","timestamp":"00:46:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But I want to get to more of them.","timestamp":"00:46:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"This is the where any kind of system and automation or anything building can help with that, right?","timestamp":"00:46:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what I, for example, with the one leads and the leads that you have in your tracker and everything, it doesn't seem like, it doesn't make sense to build anything for that because you're not dealing with a lot of inbound, right?","timestamp":"00:46:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You're not getting emails every day where people are interested and then you have to figure out how to find out how to get back to them, right?","timestamp":"00:46:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You don't have this huge inbound problem and you don't have a big database that you have to go.","timestamp":"00:46:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That you're saying, okay, look at this database, it's so huge.","timestamp":"00:47:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We need your system to help us go through the database and reach out to people.","timestamp":"00:47:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So that's, I wouldn't try to sell you on something like that.","timestamp":"00:47:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's not necessary.","timestamp":"00:47:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But my only question in my mind is like, can you reach out to more people?","timestamp":"00:47:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Are there more people to reach out to?","timestamp":"00:47:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And can you reach out to more people?","timestamp":"00:47:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, so you're working part time.","timestamp":"00:47:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Is it that there are way more producers out there that I just don't have the time to get to?","timestamp":"00:47:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because I don't have the hours in the day.","timestamp":"00:47:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"How can I help you with that?","timestamp":"00:47:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right?","timestamp":"00:47:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or maybe it's that it's not about a numbers game, because the industry and the amount of producers, it's not that many, right?","timestamp":"00:47:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's not that many.","timestamp":"00:47:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so we just have to look at quality.","timestamp":"00:47:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We have to look at like, getting one customer in, and then churning the LTV on that customer.","timestamp":"00:47:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You know what I'm saying?","timestamp":"00:47:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, maybe it's not about a numbers game where you're like, I'm going to build you an automated system that's going to move.","timestamp":"00:47:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'll help you get 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 8,000 leads, because maybe there aren't 8,000 producers out there that need that product.","timestamp":"00:48:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Maybe it's 100, and the goal is, like, if I can get five pitch decks over a year or whatever time period from one customer, then the business model can work.","timestamp":"00:48:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You understand what I mean?","timestamp":"00:48:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so maybe, like, that's kind of a question maybe you guys have to ask yourself, like, what's the business model?","timestamp":"00:48:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Is the business model, we need to get as many producers in as possible.","timestamp":"00:48:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And get as many pitch decks, or is it we need to get the people that need it, the quality people that need it, and we only need, like, 200 a year, or even 50 a year, but they're going to do it over and over.","timestamp":"00:48:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They're going to give us five different pitch decks.","timestamp":"00:48:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And if that's the case, then the approach is different.","timestamp":"00:48:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We're really looking at, like, taking a long time to build that relationship with those people, a longer time, very, very, like, point to point, you know, and very, very, very structured, very unique.","timestamp":"00:48:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Building a relationship with them, building a friendship, getting them a deal, you know, that's how you do maybe do it with the feedback thing, hey, you get their trust, you build something for them a lot cheaper, get their value in there, oh, , they need another pitch deck, they're not going to go to another company.","timestamp":"00:49:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then you're just really kind of looking at that source again.","timestamp":"00:49:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Anyways, I'm just kind of...","timestamp":"00:49:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's so clever.","timestamp":"00:49:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Thank you so much, Sway.","timestamp":"00:49:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But it may be a way to look at that.","timestamp":"00:49:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I would say, the last question I would ask is like, of the things that you do, Richard, what are the things, like if you had an assistant, if you had an assistant, what are the things that you would give to the assistant?","timestamp":"00:49:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What are the things that you're doing that are either difficult or annoying to do?","timestamp":"00:49:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So difficult meaning like, I really struggle with doing this, I really struggle with getting these leads, or I really struggle with following up with people, or I really struggle with talking to people, I don't know, whatever that thing is.","timestamp":"00:49:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then what is...","timestamp":"00:49:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's just kind of, man, I've to do this every day, and I just hate it.","timestamp":"00:50:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"This is just annoying.","timestamp":"00:50:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'd rather just give this to someone else, like an assistant.","timestamp":"00:50:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah, I would say probably finding leads is a pretty laborious process, and it does, after a while, just make your eyes want to start bleeding.","timestamp":"00:50:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So, yeah, that's the thing, and quite often you'll end up in a dead end because, obviously, you know, they don't want to publish their contact details for whatever reason, so you sort of chase this person around for, like, five minutes, and then you can't find anything about them.","timestamp":"00:50:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So, I mean, that would be, yeah, that would be something that would, but then, like, I'm still unsure if we're going, because my initial instinct, and I have no sales background, I had one job when I was working in a call center, and I sucked.","timestamp":"00:50:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Honestly, I was terrible.","timestamp":"00:50:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Tell me the anecdote, because I think it's pretty funny.","timestamp":"00:50:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Oh, well, yeah, so I got this, I was working for Greenpeace, but it wasn't really Greenpeace.","timestamp":"00:50:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Anyway, so, I think it's pretty Yeah.","timestamp":"00:50:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I managed to get this old lady to sign up for, like, £7 a month, but then she was like, I only get £40 a month on my pension, so I was like, oh, don't do this, like, so I basically, I talked her out of the sale, and I didn't realise that my manager was, like, listening in on my call, and I just got the finger into his room, and that was the end of my sales, he was like, why would you do that?","timestamp":"00:51:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What are you doing, dude?","timestamp":"00:51:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What are you doing?","timestamp":"00:51:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I was sort of going, my instinct was to go for quantity.","timestamp":"00:51:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Really, it was just like, bang, bang, bang, let's get out to as many people as possible, if we get 5% from that, that's fantastic, but now we're potentially talking about quality, not quantity, so, in that case, it would be maybe, like, researching producers and finding out, yeah, sort of, like, where they went on holiday last week, or what movie they're about to start working on, so, so, yeah, it would be that, just that sort of background stuff, I suppose.","timestamp":"00:51:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"What about an approach, sorry, because I always think it's a little bit...","timestamp":"00:51:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"When you're like, sorry, the term that I think there's a better way of saying it, but yeah, it's an ugly term, but like the kind of  licking, oh, you've done such a beautiful, like, I think, would there be a different way being like, hey, I'm Richard, I'm a, you know, I don't know, I'm a screenwriter, I also work for this company, make these great decks, I love what you do, would love to have a chat.","timestamp":"00:52:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So it's not like, oh, look at our decks, but it's not either, I don't know, do you know what mean, like, is it all about flattery, I don't know, like.","timestamp":"00:52:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's a tough one, I think it depends, it depends on your relationship to the person, it depends on if this person's a connection to someone else, or it's a straight up cold person, like somebody in Albania that's, you know, doing movie production.","timestamp":"00:52:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I think that, I agree with you with the  licking, but I think that there's two ways around that, one is, well, the first thing is always value, anybody that you can't.","timestamp":"00:52:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"How can you provide them value before you ask them for something?","timestamp":"00:53:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's just a general approach.","timestamp":"00:53:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so value would be, you know, in your position as a writer or your position as a pitch deck, selling pitch decks, or as a producer, whatever it is, how can I provide, the question would be, how can I provide value to producers in general or my target audience before asking them anything?","timestamp":"00:53:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And that may be different for every person, right?","timestamp":"00:53:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so, but when you take this approach, people are far more receptive than, hey, I've got this product.","timestamp":"00:53:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Hey, I'm from this company.","timestamp":"00:53:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Do you want this thing from me, right?","timestamp":"00:53:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Everybody knows what that is, right?","timestamp":"00:53:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And the other approach is, take it slow.","timestamp":"00:53:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I think sometimes you're like, okay, I'm going to reach out to 10 people today.","timestamp":"00:53:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But some of it is also how you're reaching out to people, not just, hey, I'm f***ing","timestamp":"00:53:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Richard, from here, this is what I do, and then trying to pack everything into one email, break it up, break it up into three different emails, like have a strategy that says, the first thing I do is I just reach out on LinkedIn, and I just like their post, or I comment on their post, or I comment on something that they did, just that, right?","timestamp":"00:54:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then you look at the next, like, if you want to do it in three days, or four days, or a rotation of like every seven days, then you go back to that person, and you say, I don't know, maybe you do another comment, right, like they see you and they see that, then they see your name in the feed, or something like this, right?","timestamp":"00:54:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then, maybe the third step is, I offer them some kind of value, hey, I saw that you're doing this, this, and that, you know what worked for me, when I did X, Y, and Z, all right, man, hope you have a great day, boom, you get a response from them, they're like, oh , how did you do that, or thank you for that, and then they may ask, what do you do?","timestamp":"00:54:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Then you're like, by the way, well, I actually provide pitch decks so that you're not selling.","timestamp":"00:55:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"That's the key.","timestamp":"00:55:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You don't want to be like, I do pitch decks.","timestamp":"00:55:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You want to be like, I provided you value.","timestamp":"00:55:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Then people are like, who the  is this Richard guy?","timestamp":"00:55:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Thank you.","timestamp":"00:55:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And the beauty in all of this, Sway, is that both Richard and I have other ambitions in the industry.","timestamp":"00:55:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"You know, like we want to produce, we want to write, like, you know, we want to meet producers.","timestamp":"00:55:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Because, in other words, all of this, if we do it that way, it's not time wasted because even if it doesn't become a pitch deck, it will somehow be some, you know, the contacts that could be partners later, you know.","timestamp":"00:55:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because you've got this kind of company merging thing where people can come over here and then they can get a service over here and they can get another service over there.","timestamp":"00:55:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Exactly.","timestamp":"00:55:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And, you know, and we always look for, you know, co-producers, et cetera, people who might invest in our films or whatever.","timestamp":"00:55:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So, you know, that's what I mean.","timestamp":"00:55:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Like, it could be, yeah, I think it's a very clever approach.","timestamp":"00:55:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:55:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad

you're like, between doing my writing, between this, between that, I just don't have a lot of time to get new leads.","timestamp":"00:56:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If that's something that, like, there could be a possibility of building something for that.","timestamp":"00:56:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Would need to have some questions around, like, who, like, who is that target audience?","timestamp":"00:56:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Where are they?","timestamp":"00:56:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Where are they, right?","timestamp":"00:56:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Are they LinkedIn?","timestamp":"00:56:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Are they on

Facebook?","timestamp":"00:56:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, where are those people?","timestamp":"00:56:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And what kind of approaches work best for those individuals?","timestamp":"00:56:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Is it emails?","timestamp":"00:56:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Are the email lists?","timestamp":"00:56:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, kind of having that understanding.","timestamp":"00:56:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then I could maybe give you a proposal of, like, okay, if we were to build something that would help you find leads, this is what it could be, and this is what, you know what I mean?","timestamp":"00:56:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And, and, and in that.","timestamp":"00:56:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And in that respect, right, like, that would be the only thing right now that I would see where there could be anything.","timestamp":"00:57:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I'm thinking, sorry, and I could be wrong, because really we want to have an approach that is, as you said, I think qualitative rather than quantitative.","timestamp":"00:57:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So do you think there would be tools to be like, okay, everyone knows, well, not everyone, because we're not talking about, like, you know, big movie stars like that.","timestamp":"00:57:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So there are people that are very, that might be super established in the industry, but nobody knows their name necessarily, and there might not be a ton of things on the internet about them.","timestamp":"00:57:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But what you could do, I guess, is could, sorry, could a system help you basically find all the information, tell you what, you know, for example, say, hey, there's like, there's like a three-minute interview of him on YouTube that is cool to watch, because you're going to learn a lot about him as a person or whatever, you know.","timestamp":"00:57:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And then basically, yeah, make the process of researching quicker, so that, you know, you spend 10 minutes.","timestamp":"00:57:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"related to","timestamp":"00:57:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Just going through it, you feel like you've got a real grasp of who the person is, and then you can attack your personalized email.","timestamp":"00:58:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Would a tool like that be possible to build?","timestamp":"00:58:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I'd have to look into it.","timestamp":"00:58:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, there's a couple of steps in there.","timestamp":"00:58:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"There's finding the people, even if they exist, and then you manually do the research.","timestamp":"00:58:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"For example, that's one way.","timestamp":"00:58:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"There's finding and then helping you with the research, and then you manually send the emails.","timestamp":"00:58:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, there may be different versions that I'd have to look at what is actually possible with the technology and what's affordable, right?","timestamp":"00:58:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because at the same time, you can build any system.","timestamp":"00:58:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But at the end of day, you're like, okay, how much does this cost to build, right?","timestamp":"00:58:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But I think that, you know, the easiest way would obviously be something that helps Richard find new contacts.","timestamp":"00:58:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And from there, Richard can do the research to be like, okay, every week, I got 10 contacts, I'm going to do my full research on them, find out who they are, and then put together a system, like build a system that says,","timestamp":"00:58:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"For every lead, I check here, I check here, I check here, I check here, then I draft an email, and then maybe there's like a chat GPT prompt that helps you draft the email once you put in all the information.","timestamp":"00:59:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like there are many different ways to kind of skin a cat, right?","timestamp":"00:59:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But it really depends on if this is a necessary thing.","timestamp":"00:59:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like we have to decide on what would it take to build it and if it's necessary, right?","timestamp":"00:59:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So.","timestamp":"00:59:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay, great.","timestamp":"00:59:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad

afternoon.","timestamp":"00:59:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And then, Sway, honestly, thank you so much.","timestamp":"00:59:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Thank you so much,

fantastic.","timestamp":"00:59:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sindbad Iksel","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"What we could do, if you want, is Richard and I send a little message
