sideways.","timestamp":"00:00:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You're on your phone, right?","timestamp":"00:00:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, I'm on the iPad.","timestamp":"00:00:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I think you've to turn it somehow.","timestamp":"00:00:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, before I didn't.","timestamp":"00:00:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Let me see.","timestamp":"00:00:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Did you move it at all?","timestamp":"00:00:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, not at all.","timestamp":"00:00:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Something seems like it's just the landscape changed or something.","timestamp":"00:00:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah, it flips sideways.","timestamp":"00:00:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I don't know why.","timestamp":"00:00:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But we can talk while I try to figure it out.","timestamp":"00:00:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Well, I think I think at the end of it, it's like, like I saying, I'm wary of chasing my tail in certain situations because I do have like a lot of projects that I'm I am building at the moment.","timestamp":"00:00:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so I really would like to hyper focus on like I keep saying real problems.","timestamp":"00:00:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And when I say when I say real problems, I mean like a problem that that you are actually having that if.","timestamp":"00:00:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If you solved it would, would have like a dramatic change on your business.","timestamp":"00:00:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:01:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And, and I think it, because my belief is that, that, that, that, that those are the problems that people pay for.","timestamp":"00:01:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And those are the problems that other people also have.","timestamp":"00:01:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right.","timestamp":"00:01:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So, um, there you go, um, listen, you can talk.","timestamp":"00:01:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:01:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:01:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So that's, that's, that's where, where I'm, where I'm sitting on it.","timestamp":"00:01:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You know what I mean?","timestamp":"00:01:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's like, um, I need to just be very like focused or very intentional about a better word, a very intentional of like, okay, what this is right.","timestamp":"00:01:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And what, what, what, what this is and what this isn't.","timestamp":"00:01:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so again, like back when I thought it when for me, my, my initial reason of talking was either for two things.","timestamp":"00:01:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If you were like, Hey, uh, you know, in my construction business, this is the problem that I'm having.","timestamp":"00:01:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or these are the problems that I have, and it's a really  big problem.","timestamp":"00:02:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And if I don't solve it, I'm going to have some really big issues moving forward.","timestamp":"00:02:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's like a real problem to me.","timestamp":"00:02:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or it's also like, hey, I know other construction companies that I've worked with or other people in the industry that I can put you in touch with that may be interested in that, right?","timestamp":"00:02:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But what I don't want to do is chase an idea that, like, building something that, even with the idea that I'm going to sell this to, like, all of these people, like, to this market.","timestamp":"00:02:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, that's not the way I fundamentally look at things.","timestamp":"00:02:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I really look at things on a customizable sense first for the individual that I'm dealing with.","timestamp":"00:02:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, with your business, what is it that you need?","timestamp":"00:02:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What are the problems?","timestamp":"00:02:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"How can we build something to solve that problem?","timestamp":"00:02:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I just believe, if it is such a real problem, that other people do have it.","timestamp":"00:02:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And that's when selling becomes, that's when it's like, then it's like, yo, this is what I paid for this thing, it's total value, it's helped me with my business, it's helped me generate this many more leads, or it's helped me save this amount of time, it's helped me stop doing this, and so forth, right?","timestamp":"00:03:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So, like, for example, I know of a girl, a woman who works in also in this industry, and it made me think about something that she works where?","timestamp":"00:03:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"She works also with what I do, like, I like solutions and stuff like this.","timestamp":"00:03:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And she was telling me about something that she had worked on, which is like, you, like a contractor was able to go to a house.","timestamp":"00:03:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, speak into their, like their, make a message, like basically a voice message of like, what they needed, what they saw, what, what, what they, what the materials are that they need, whatever that cost was, and generate.","timestamp":"00:03:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Sway Clarke, just from that, generate a proposal that went out to the client by the time they got to their car, right?","timestamp":"00:04:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so this was something that that person was like, look, I will pay money to have you create this solution for me that can do this thing.","timestamp":"00:04:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because doing this is just a waste of my  time, or it takes a lot of time, or I hate doing it, and I'll pay you 500 bucks or whatever that is to get rid of that problem because I don't want that problem anymore.","timestamp":"00:04:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But, but how, I'm trying to think if, if she create that and this, it's almost like you speak into almost AI, AI creates your file, right?","timestamp":"00:04:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, I mean, you're talking about the technical side of it?","timestamp":"00:04:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah, because if, if, if I speak, if I speak to my nodes, you create this for me and I speak to my nodes, the system is going to be already be trained.","timestamp":"00:04:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"to understand how trying to think about how to come up.","timestamp":"00:04:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"with a number somehow yeah for sure yeah okay for sure i found that i found that it can be hit and miss i mean this this this product that that she's used for this person has it's it's a it's a hit it's not it's it's not a miss situation right it's it it really depends on again everything is very very um it's very customized right and that that's the that's what i would like to say it's just more of like is ai ever going to be a hundred percent no but but every human being is not a hundred percent yeah it's not like you're going to get all the right pricing at the right time for every every situation right it's it's not really like that but the question is um does it help you does it solve a problem that you have and helps you either make more money or helps you save more time so you can make more money right like those are kind of the fundamental questions of like what these kind of solutions","timestamp":"00:05:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We were just talking Sway Antonio Beccati, Antonio Beccati, Antonio Beccati, Antonio Beccati, Antonio Beccati.","timestamp":"00:06:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Decide what that problem is, and I got to understand it in super detail, then I'd come back with a proposal and I'd say, well, for this or this, this is what I would charge to build this thing for you, for example.","timestamp":"00:06:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I like that idea because it can work for real estate agents because let's say I call the realtor and it comes to a house to evaluate the house.","timestamp":"00:06:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And it can, as soon as he parks the car in the driveway, it can, you know, fire up this application.","timestamp":"00:06:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And say, start making these notes, the driveway needs to be paved, that can cause maybe a potential client to complain.","timestamp":"00:07:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"You can start making these notes.","timestamp":"00:07:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I see that working for stuff like that, even for what are we going to try to do with the real estate industry, with the selling of the homes.","timestamp":"00:07:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Because I can walk into a house, and I can just fire up and say, okay, wall is going to be painted, it can be 12 or 24, big splash is going be done.","timestamp":"00:07:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And at the end of the day, like you say, the system is trained to create a funnel, let's call it a funnel quote with a number.","timestamp":"00:07:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"But before you leave, the client has it.","timestamp":"00:07:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's something, right?","timestamp":"00:07:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, we're talking about right now, what we're talking about is the fundamental of it.","timestamp":"00:07:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, need, you're like, ah, I want something that's going to help me create my proposal, my quotes a little quicker, because this is taking me a lot of time.","timestamp":"00:08:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right.","timestamp":"00:08:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So, and, and so that's, that's solving a problem for that individual.","timestamp":"00:08:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'm just giving you an example of what that solves for that individual.","timestamp":"00:08:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But for example, you didn't say to me, like, one of my biggest problems is I have to take all this time and effort to create these proposals.","timestamp":"00:08:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right.","timestamp":"00:08:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That wasn't something that you were like, oh my God, I would , I hate this .","timestamp":"00:08:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, I hate it with a passion, to be honest.","timestamp":"00:08:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:08:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And if you had an assistant, you're like, I would give this to an assistant, 100%.","timestamp":"00:08:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And is it, and is that a problem you would pay to get rid of?","timestamp":"00:08:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's the question.","timestamp":"00:08:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If it makes sense.","timestamp":"00:08:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:08:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"If it makes me money.","timestamp":"00:08:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yes, of course.","timestamp":"00:08:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, it's, a no brainer.","timestamp":"00:08:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And, and the question is how much time does it take from your, like every job?","timestamp":"00:08:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because it comes in with every lead, right?","timestamp":"00:08:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You got to do a proposal.","timestamp":"00:08:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So how much time does lead,","timestamp":"00:08:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"It depends on how big the project would be.","timestamp":"00:09:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:09:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"It's based on that.","timestamp":"00:09:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And it usually takes, by the time I get back to a client, it can be two or three days.","timestamp":"00:09:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Two or three days.","timestamp":"00:09:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:09:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:09:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, is, yeah, I guess it, what I would leave you with is, there are a few things that we talked about, and there's a few things that I have, I would have an idea of saying, okay, I think this is a big problem for you, but I don't want to assume anything.","timestamp":"00:09:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I think what you could do is, maybe the next day or so, really write down what you think are your top three most annoying things that you do.","timestamp":"00:09:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, if I can, if I had an assistant, or if I could pay for this to be gone, these are the top three things.","timestamp":"00:09:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And if they match up, maybe we could look at building one of those things to relieve you of that, of that issue.","timestamp":"00:09:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You know what I'm saying?","timestamp":"00:09:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But, yeah.","timestamp":"00:09:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's,","timestamp":"00:09:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's a start.","timestamp":"00:10:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"That's a start, yeah.","timestamp":"00:10:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"For sure.","timestamp":"00:10:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:10:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Because if I do have that issue, like you said, many people have it.","timestamp":"00:10:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:10:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And that's the thing.","timestamp":"00:10:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I don't try to overthink it, right?","timestamp":"00:10:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's really like, what is a real problem?","timestamp":"00:10:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And let me help you build a real problem to solve a real problem.","timestamp":"00:10:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or a real solution to solve a real problem.","timestamp":"00:10:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because if that's the case, if you're like, look, it takes me three days to get back to on a quote, and I have to do all this work.","timestamp":"00:10:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I could actually, if I could get back in a half a day, with a quote, then I'm up on the competitor, right?","timestamp":"00:10:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The competitor takes three days, five days, I take half a day, I can get through more and more leads more quickly.","timestamp":"00:10:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You know what mean?","timestamp":"00:10:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, there's so many things to it, but it's really like, I think the real question to always ask yourself in this situation is, how bad is this problem?","timestamp":"00:10:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If I had an assistant, would I give this job to them?","timestamp":"00:10:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And would I pay to get rid of this problem?","timestamp":"00:10:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Those the questions, and if so, then it's a real problem.","timestamp":"00:11:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If not, then it's not a real problem.","timestamp":"00:11:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I would love the idea of quoting pricing because it would give me more opportunity to go out there and generate leads on my own.","timestamp":"00:11:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"If I don't have a lead generator, I can hit clients and send quotes.","timestamp":"00:11:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And then if you really want to do the job with me, then you wait from BC, otherwise you get somebody else.","timestamp":"00:11:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Sorry, say that again because we

different things for you, right?","timestamp":"00:11:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Well, it falls in the same category.","timestamp":"00:11:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:11:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

away.","timestamp":"00:11:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Thank","timestamp":"00:11:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"and send a price right away because if i if i'm able if i can generate leads like you say are able to handle 100 leads a month maybe i can price 100 leads a month if i have a system that can help me and i can pick and choose whatever i want from there because i can say to the client you know what i'm busy if can wait for me you wait for me otherwise you know they have to get somebody else well those are two different machines right yes yeah lead machine is a is a system in itself that would have its own quirks of what it is yes and then there's a quote machine which which has its own yes yeah i quote machine would be ideal because that's something that everybody will use it and let me you keep saying everybody use it i'm thinking about you so i mean you what you want to you want to create something that we can like i said i started in one right if it if at the end of the day it's just something that you use and you're like","timestamp":"00:12:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Look, this is what I paid for

problem.","timestamp":"00:13:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But I think when it comes to this quote machine, and I think this is a question I just want to ask, where do you get your pricing from now?","timestamp":"00:13:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

now?","timestamp":"00:13:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"See, I sent, for example, I sent a

long.","timestamp":"00:13:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"And I went to, I went to Rona, and I spoke to the

Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Almost two and a half weeks and I haven't received anything like I'm losing a job and you get nothing from me because you know I'm gonna buy anything from from from you guys so that's dependent you're dependent on a Rona to give you material costs which you're not getting quick enough on certain things yes let's say I get like I say I get a full plan like like like architectural drawings I'm sent to them and they're not getting back on time so if you create this this machine that can quote it can create a generator price based on the dimensions that's amazing yeah that's it that's something I mean that's something we're talking about I think it sounds a bit fantastical in a way that how I how I imagine these things work is you have to have some kind of pricing system correct like you have to have have some kind of okay","timestamp":"00:14:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Home Depot is $399, okay, Rona is $299, okay, you know, there's some kind of pricing system, and you're going to do this either two ways, you're going to price, you're going to go to these places, and they have existing information that you're going to pull and price it, or you're going to have a database that is going to have the pricing, and you're going to read from there, you're going to read from one of the two, but it's not, there's no way for it to create a price.","timestamp":"00:15:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Based off of a dimension, if you understand what I mean.","timestamp":"00:15:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yes, no, I hear you, but can the machine, we have all the machines, be trained, based on the database, we're inputting, and keep updating, based on the market value, that's this month, for example, maybe that 2x4 is no more 29, it's a $325, I know that $0.26, it's not a big impact, but when you buy thousands of them, it's a lot.","timestamp":"00:15:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So can the machine, not just that, let me rephrase, can the machine create a material list based on the drawings?","timestamp":"00:16:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

well.","timestamp":"00:16:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Because I can say, you know, if I have this machine, I can either forward the PDF to the system.","timestamp":"00:16:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Actually, that would be the only way of doing it, forward the PDF into the system, and the machine would just start generating, you know, a mini square feet of shingles, little bit of force, blah, blah, blah, blah, all this stuff.","timestamp":"00:16:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Why?","timestamp":"00:17:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So that way you can create, instead of me, try to figure out and calculate the length of the walls, and then the two by fours I need, the machine will do it for me.","timestamp":"00:17:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay, so right now what you're saying is you get this PDF and then you have to go through the PDF and calculate what all this stuff is.","timestamp":"00:17:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

used.","timestamp":"00:17:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So instead of me sitting over there, let's say if I get drawings for a home,

calculating your pricing.","timestamp":"00:23:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Most of the time would be studying the drawings, and come

going to zoom me to go finish while you sorry she couldn't get there's no internet at home no worries my mom she said it to your shoulders she couldn't get a hold of her and she's afraid something happened no worries no worries i gotta run through it anyway okay so what i'm what i'm trying i'm just trying to like understand it right so for you it's like i gotta i gotta do all these calculations and material costs and adding up and and going online and searching for these products or going anywhere and making these well i mean at the end of the day you're always going to make the phone call","timestamp":"00:24:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"See if you can get a better price,

thing because i don't know if that i mean how does how do you get that into a machine it's no no no what i'm saying what i'm saying yeah there's there's machines you will stay opposed to a business depot specific machines for contractors for builders you go there and you print your drawings it's way way easy to read it way easy to understand and everything is in in a bigger uh the writing it's in a bigger format so chance you miss something it's going to be you know very slim but you mean you go that you take this document and you go to like yeah i'll forward the email you print it out in a bigger form yes i i uh uh soon","timestamp":"00:28:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"An email to Business Depot, and they print it for

just...","timestamp":"00:29:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, no, no.","timestamp":"00:29:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I just want it to be printed that big and do it for me that

be a foot.","timestamp":"00:29:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"So basically, if you measure 10-16ths, which if you add the 10-16ths, it's just over two inches, I think.","timestamp":"00:29:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Yeah, just over two

learn.","timestamp":"00:29:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio Beccati","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"that as well okay no interesting very interesting um yeah send me like i mean you probably have a couple examples send me a couple examples let me um let me talk with uh some of my developers and see if this is possible i have no idea yeah i will yeah if you can pull that that would be amazing so that's that's the thing that's the like i don't i that if you can get that thing dude i'm good but that will make life life much easier for me because like i said 99 uh percent of the job is completed and i just gotta pick up the numbers the machine spits out and send out an email let's say 95 percent because i would have to sit here still do five percent and that's and that's that's huge that's interesting that's interesting okay okay let me um yeah you you you know what do me","timestamp":"00:30:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway
