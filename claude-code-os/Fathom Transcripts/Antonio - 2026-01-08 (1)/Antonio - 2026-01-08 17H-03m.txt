Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But yeah, how's everything going, though?","timestamp":"00:00:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's up and down, man.","timestamp":"00:00:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's been actually...","timestamp":"00:00:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"2025 was a very bad year, let's say.","timestamp":"00:00:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I can agree.","timestamp":"00:00:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:00:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So it's...","timestamp":"00:00:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I'm trying to establish a couple of things.","timestamp":"00:00:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And, you know,","timestamp":"00:00:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"But you know the number one thing, it's always a financing, right?","timestamp":"00:00:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Finances, yeah, for sure.","timestamp":"00:01:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Yeah, it's always a hiccup.","timestamp":"00:01:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"You reach a point that you're ready to go and then financing is not coming true.","timestamp":"00:01:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Ah, okay.","timestamp":"00:01:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You mean investors and stuff.","timestamp":"00:01:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.","timestamp":"00:01:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Because I have a company that's called Linbec capital Corp.","timestamp":"00:01:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Oh, look, I'm trying to be you, Luke.","timestamp":"00:01:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It looks good.","timestamp":"00:01:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It looks good, though.","timestamp":"00:01:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I have another company that we're doing trading and that we trade, for the most part, we try to trade a large quantity of oil, like a diesel, jet fuel, heavy diesel.","timestamp":"00:01:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So it's taking me, I'm on my third year, it's taking me that long.","timestamp":"00:01:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So we just make, we just made contacts with some refineries and we try to get some serious value.","timestamp":"00:01:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So that's where we're standing right now with that, but, you know, my bread and butter has always been the construction.","timestamp":"00:02:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.","timestamp":"00:02:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But just so I understand, you've been trying to start a business with some other guys or girls, I don't know, some other people, and you want to trade oil, but you haven't been able to break that market yet.","timestamp":"00:02:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"No, because we tried to build a solid platform, which is in the works, and we have made contacts in Europe, in Rotterdam, in Houston, US, Asia, you know, Bermuda.","timestamp":"00:02:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So we are, we actually have, we are, I can say we're maybe at the verge of breaking through it, but that is guaranteed.","timestamp":"00:02:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"But why do you want to trade oil?","timestamp":"00:02:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'm just curious.","timestamp":"00:02:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'm curious.","timestamp":"00:02:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Um.","timestamp":"00:02:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"You guys make money?","timestamp":"00:02:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Yeah?","timestamp":"00:03:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I don't know anything about this business.","timestamp":"00:03:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's why I'm asking.","timestamp":"00:03:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Oh, it's huge.","timestamp":"00:03:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Usually the way it works, let's say somebody buys a million barrels of jet fuel a month, and that's a contract for one year, 12 months, that's 12 million barrels, and usually we get a dollar per barrel.","timestamp":"00:03:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"That's like $12 million.","timestamp":"00:03:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:03:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If you can make that deal.","timestamp":"00:03:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:03:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And $1 million barrels is typically a small order.","timestamp":"00:03:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Usually it's like $2 million to $4 million barrels a month.","timestamp":"00:03:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what is the hiccup?","timestamp":"00:03:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What's the tough part?","timestamp":"00:03:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like getting the deal done or getting the upfront money to buy?","timestamp":"00:03:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, no.","timestamp":"00:03:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I don't have to come up with any money.","timestamp":"00:03:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"The tough part is to have a serious buyer who's got the money that he's buying and does whatever he wants.","timestamp":"00:03:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Because we are buying directly from the refinery.","timestamp":"00:03:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"mandate for the refinery.","timestamp":"00:03:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:03:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So you have a refinery, and you're trying to find the buyers that are going to buy the oil from you.","timestamp":"00:03:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The actual fuel, yes.","timestamp":"00:04:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"These buyers, the ones that you're talking to, are either not serious, or they're buying from someone else, because people are getting oil from somewhere.","timestamp":"00:04:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Oh, but you know what, when you, let's say I'm calling you, you know, and I'm trying to establish a business, you tell me you're a broker, you have a buyer.","timestamp":"00:04:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"But if you personally don't know the buyer, then forget about it, because you know the broker, who knows the broker, who knows the broker, who knows the broker, who knows the buyer.","timestamp":"00:04:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah.","timestamp":"00:04:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"By the time it goes down there, people are getting so greedy, and the deal doesn't happen.","timestamp":"00:04:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"The deal doesn't happen.","timestamp":"00:04:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:04:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The hardest part is getting straight to the buyer.","timestamp":"00:04:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Correct.","timestamp":"00:04:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Interesting.","timestamp":"00:04:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's very interesting.","timestamp":"00:04:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So it's coming down to who you know, who's who, who do you know, the network, the contacts, blah, blah, blah.","timestamp":"00:04:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You got it.","timestamp":"00:04:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"turn, pension confidence.","timestamp":"00:04:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I Who","timestamp":"00:04:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"You got it.","timestamp":"00:05:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"What a business, man.","timestamp":"00:05:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's a good, once you break through it, you don't need to do nothing else.","timestamp":"00:05:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's it, you're done.","timestamp":"00:05:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Your belt is established.","timestamp":"00:05:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"The problem is breaking into that .","timestamp":"00:05:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"The problem is breaking into that , yes.","timestamp":"00:05:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Well, I wish I knew some oil buyers, man.","timestamp":"00:05:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'd set you up, but I don't.","timestamp":"00:05:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, I don't know what it means.","timestamp":"00:05:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I have a friend that just, one of my best friends just moved to Abu Dhabi.","timestamp":"00:05:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.","timestamp":"00:05:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What is he doing?","timestamp":"00:05:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"He's a business consultant, and he's been in business consulting for many, many years.","timestamp":"00:05:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"does, like, not a freelance, but

to.","timestamp":"00:05:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I do coaching of high-powered executives, that's where he's working, but he used to live in Berlin, and he just moved to Abu Dhabi because he wanted the tax break, so he was like,  it, we're gone, and so he just moved over there, and his wife, they just had a kid, so she's not really working at the moment, but yeah, so if there's anything I can do on that front, I can always put you in contact with him, he's a really good buddy of mine, but he can always ask, I'm sure he doesn't have any hard, crazy contact at the moment, but something may pop up, you never know.","timestamp":"00:06:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Yeah, listen, this is how you establish, I always refer to a circle of trust, a circle of people, of elite people, that if I say, Steve, you know what, I can be in Germany on Thursday, we meet at such a place, and I'll be there.","timestamp":"00:06:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"You

when we say something that's going to happen, it's going to be a very good reason of why it's not happening.","timestamp":"00:07:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's all.","timestamp":"00:07:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

with.","timestamp":"00:07:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"But, uh, I feel you, man.","timestamp":"00:07:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"A hundred percent.","timestamp":"00:07:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I understand.","timestamp":"00:07:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"But, um, yeah, tell me, tell me a little bit about, uh,

ended up leaving.","timestamp":"00:07:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And, um, I think one thing that a lot of people don't know about me, I I've kind of graduated, like my, before I went into music, I graduated from, uh, it, I was doing information technology technology.","timestamp":"00:07:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's why I did my degree.","timestamp":"00:07:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But I never, I never wanted to like, I like, I've always had an interest.","timestamp":"00:07:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But I didn't do anything with it.","timestamp":"00:08:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So I became a musician did that for like, you know, years, 20 years.","timestamp":"00:08:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And after Corona, I didn't really want to do the music anymore.","timestamp":"00:08:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I got into the startup, and it got me back into the tech field, got me back into like, what's happening in tech.","timestamp":"00:08:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I fell into AI, actually, around 2020, and just started like, building stuff for myself and creating different, like, you know, understanding where it was going, creating different workflows, automations and things for myself.","timestamp":"00:08:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And after I left the startup, I went into coaching, I became a parent coach.","timestamp":"00:08:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so I started to do a lot of consulting and working with people.","timestamp":"00:08:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I was coaching parents about with their kids and tantrums and all that kind of crazy stuff.","timestamp":"00:08:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And it just all came together this year, over the summer, when I realized how everything came to a head, I was actually working with some coaches who were asking me to build, build products that I built for myself for them.","timestamp":"00:08:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I realized at this moment, I was like, actually, this","timestamp":"00:08:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So the move.","timestamp":"00:09:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, I don't want to do that.","timestamp":"00:09:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'm going to move from the coaching for a second.","timestamp":"00:09:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'm going to take all my consulting experience that I've done with them.","timestamp":"00:09:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I'm going to take my tech experience of building, and I'm going to start helping businesses build solutions for AI.","timestamp":"00:09:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And essentially, what I'm doing is, I call it more of like an AI transformation partner, all these businesses around the world.","timestamp":"00:09:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Sorry, I may stop you on and off because I don't want to lose what I want to ask you while you're talking.","timestamp":"00:09:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"What do mean build a solution for AI?","timestamp":"00:09:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So this is basically what it is, is every business on the planet right now needs to figure out how to cut costs and be more productive.","timestamp":"00:09:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's the two things they need to figure out how to make more money and how to cut costs.","timestamp":"00:09:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And the old version of that is always, let's hire more people.","timestamp":"00:09:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And let's hire people.","timestamp":"00:09:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And that's not happening anymore.","timestamp":"00:09:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So people are trying to understand right now, how can I use AI in my business?","timestamp":"00:09:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So the solution, the problem becomes, for example, for example, I work with a debt advisor who, he's the guy between, you know, there's a commercial real estate property that needs $200 million, and then there's the private investors and banks that need to put their money somewhere, and he's that guy in the middle, right?","timestamp":"00:10:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so, what I'm working on with him is that half of his, like, time of the day is about documents, analyzing documents, looking at documents, documenting documents, you know what I'm saying, like, and for all of these clients, he's got to do this, this is like, five to 10 hours of every client he deals with, so at the end of the year, he's only able to deal with six clients, because it's just so much work, so much documentation.","timestamp":"00:10:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so what he wants to do is, how can I use AI, and how can I use technology to get that five to 10 hours down to, like, 30 minutes, and at that point in time, I can get more clients.","timestamp":"00:10:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So basically, you are...","timestamp":"00:10:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Or you're training AI to do a specific job.","timestamp":"00:11:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It really depends.","timestamp":"00:11:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It really depends.","timestamp":"00:11:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like what it is, is about 10-20% of my job is actually AI.","timestamp":"00:11:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because you don't always need to use AI.","timestamp":"00:11:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Some of it is just what we call automations.","timestamp":"00:11:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So in the field of like, in the field of technology right now, you can use something called the automation, which is not necessarily AI, but it's just creating a system that is going to take maybe information from A to Z without you, before you had to do it.","timestamp":"00:11:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Sorry, sorry guys, I want to understand it.","timestamp":"00:11:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, no, no, no.","timestamp":"00:11:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It's all good.","timestamp":"00:11:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So basically when it picks up A to Z, it will analyze everything and present it back to you and say, yes, it's good or no, it's bad.","timestamp":"00:11:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"No, no, no.","timestamp":"00:11:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So let's look at it like two things.","timestamp":"00:11:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Automation, like automation is","timestamp":"00:11:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"been around for many years, and it's almost the same as like a factory.","timestamp":"00:12:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If you have a nut on a factory automation, and it's going through a process, and it gets welded, and then it goes to the next process, and it gets this, goes to the next process, that's just a basic automation.","timestamp":"00:12:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"There's no intelligence with that, right?","timestamp":"00:12:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so what I do is I would set up an automation, for example, that says, ah, you need this document moved over here, and put into here, and put over here, and you have to do this right now.","timestamp":"00:12:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I can create an automation for you.","timestamp":"00:12:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's one thing.","timestamp":"00:12:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Exactly.","timestamp":"00:12:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Now, then there's the brain to it.","timestamp":"00:12:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Now, what if he says, I don't just want to move that automation, I don't want to move that document somewhere.","timestamp":"00:12:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I want you to analyze the document and tell me what it is, or take out information from it and process information from it to give me new information.","timestamp":"00:12:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's where AI comes in, right?","timestamp":"00:12:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so, every solution doesn't need AI, right?","timestamp":"00:12:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And most-","timestamp":"00:12:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"solutions will need an automation, right?","timestamp":"00:13:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So the question and where I come in, it's actually before that, my real value is I send businesses and find out what is your real problem first.","timestamp":"00:13:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Before we get to automations and AI, the bigger problem is, what is your problem?","timestamp":"00:13:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, where's your bottleneck?","timestamp":"00:13:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Is it that you have all of this payroll processing to do?","timestamp":"00:13:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And this is like taking up tons of your time, and you don't need to be doing You don't need people to be doing that.","timestamp":"00:13:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Is it that you're trying to find leads, you need to find leads to get more leads and you're going online and finding those things?","timestamp":"00:13:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Is it that you have a communication problem between your team, and your team is not able to have one source of truth of information and somebody's over here on Slack, somebody's over here.","timestamp":"00:13:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So it's basically what I do is I sit with companies and find out what their problem is.","timestamp":"00:13:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then when they find when I find out the problem, I build them solutions for that problem.","timestamp":"00:13:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Got it.","timestamp":"00:13:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Those solutions could be very, very different, right?","timestamp":"00:13:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They can be","timestamp":"00:13:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Depending on the industry, it can be very, very different.","timestamp":"00:14:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And what people need can always be very, very different.","timestamp":"00:14:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right?","timestamp":"00:14:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So does that make sense?","timestamp":"00:14:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Yes.","timestamp":"00:14:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I think I got it.","timestamp":"00:14:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So I have a question for you.","timestamp":"00:14:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I'm the type of guy who's sitting in toilet and come up with ideas.","timestamp":"00:14:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

know a lot of people tell me, know, what are you doing?","timestamp":"00:14:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I'm on a toilet.","timestamp":"00:14:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I'm thinking.","timestamp":"00:14:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's my only time that I can actually think.","timestamp":"00:14:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So I have a couple ideas.","timestamp":"00:14:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"One idea, I'm telling you this in confidentiality, I want to create a smart, how can I call it?","timestamp":"00:14:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Like a fire alarm system for homes that has AI.","timestamp":"00:14:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Hold on.","timestamp":"00:14:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You're breaking

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What I focus on ...","timestamp":"00:15:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what you're talking about is a product.","timestamp":"00:15:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You want to develop a product.","timestamp":"00:15:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

stuff.","timestamp":"00:16:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:16:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Well, what I'm I work differently from that.","timestamp":"00:16:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what I'm what I don't do is develop products.","timestamp":"00:16:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right.","timestamp":"00:16:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What I do is I work with companies with an actual problem that needs to get solved.","timestamp":"00:16:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And the way that that would ever turn into a product is if.","timestamp":"00:16:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The solution that I build for that company can be sold to another company as a product.","timestamp":"00:16:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But I always start with a problem.","timestamp":"00:16:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

sense.","timestamp":"00:16:38"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What I'm looking for is like what I'm looking for is and why I thought about you is because every single industry needs something like this.","timestamp":"00:16:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Every single industry on Earth, real estate industry, construction industry, you know, food industry.","timestamp":"00:16:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Industry, traffic industry, it doesn't really matter.","timestamp":"00:17:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Every industry needs this.","timestamp":"00:17:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And why I thought about you is because I know that, well, my assumption is that in the construction business, there's a lot of processes that need to be updated.","timestamp":"00:17:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"There are a lot of things that construction companies do that waste a lot of time.","timestamp":"00:17:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They're manual processes.","timestamp":"00:17:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They got papers to do this.","timestamp":"00:17:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And you know what mean?","timestamp":"00:17:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"There's just a lot of things that go from A to Z that you can save a lot of time or help developers find, like, help developers make more money.","timestamp":"00:17:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And that's at the end of it, right?","timestamp":"00:17:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what I'm trying to do is, well, my interest was, I wonder if A, if Antonio knows people in the real estate business, or not, in the construction business, that are in a position where they're like, yeah, you know what, I am actually interested to find out how systems, how my systems can be improved.","timestamp":"00:17:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'm interested to find out what that is.","timestamp":"00:17:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or, two, it's like, I've worked in the construction business so long that I know of this particular problem.","timestamp":"00:18:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And if that problem can be solved, we kind of connect, we kind of use a current construction agency as a use case and say, look, I know you have this problem because I work with you or I'm in

you?","timestamp":"00:21:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's actually bad.","timestamp":"00:21:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"1 10 is what, like a 7, 8, 9?","timestamp":"00:21:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's probably a solid 7 into the 8, yeah.","timestamp":"00:21:19"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Sorry, why?","timestamp":"00:21:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Why is it so bad, exactly?","timestamp":"00:21:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, why?","timestamp":"00:21:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Because, well, I guess, for me, man, because I'm working by myself, and I got to do management, financing, pricing, schedule meetings with the clients, you know, come up with the prices, all that stuff.","timestamp":"00:21:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So that can be maybe just for me.","timestamp":"00:21:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"But it would be nice to have the system that you go back into your office and say, okay, I got to build.","timestamp":"00:21:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"This basement, it's 300 linear feet, two by four, eight feet high, 16 inch center, I input everything, and it will create all my material list, and tells me, you know, you can buy the material this place, get the best prices.","timestamp":"00:22:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay, so my question would be, okay, so actually, first of all, so I understand it.","timestamp":"00:22:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because you're a solo entrepreneur, and figuring this out all your, like yourself, this part of the business takes, what, the most time, it's the most difficult, it's the most annoying, what is it?","timestamp":"00:22:24"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's, to be honest, it's not about, it takes time, and it is annoying, it is annoying because, you know, you always try to search for the best product at a good price.","timestamp":"00:22:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And you're a point that, the heck with it, you know, and, and you just got to a number inside there, that you, that specific item can make you lose the project.","timestamp":"00:22:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So you're finding that this part of the process is detrimental because it can make or break whether you make or lose the job.","timestamp":"00:23:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:23:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And are you finding that you're losing a lot of jobs because of your pricing?","timestamp":"00:23:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Is that what you think?","timestamp":"00:23:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Most of it is pricing.","timestamp":"00:23:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"The other problem is that homeowners think they know all, they know everything, just because they're watching SGTV and deal with DIY.","timestamp":"00:23:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And then all of a sudden they go online at Home Depot, but I see that cost $100, why you charge me $300?","timestamp":"00:23:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"You know, but they don't think the fact that I have to do my research to see how much I can get it for.","timestamp":"00:23:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I have to go to a store.","timestamp":"00:23:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I have to pick it up.","timestamp":"00:23:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I have to buy it.","timestamp":"00:23:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I have to bring it to your house and I have to install it.","timestamp":"00:23:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So that's not a big problem.","timestamp":"00:23:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"They don't see all that process.","timestamp":"00:23:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Let it include...","timestamp":"00:23:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"My time on the road, my fuel, you know, my warranty on my truck, my insurance, everything is up.","timestamp":"00:24:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, yeah.","timestamp":"00:24:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So you mean you're pricing it, you're putting a profit on it, or a profit on it, so you can make money.","timestamp":"00:24:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, at the end of the Of course, yeah.","timestamp":"00:24:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:24:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so, I guess the question that I would have is like, of all the issues that you have, is this the worst one?","timestamp":"00:24:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I think this is one, I can probably say this is number one.","timestamp":"00:24:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Number two will be payments.","timestamp":"00:24:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"What's the problem with payments?","timestamp":"00:24:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Keep the schedule with payments, and be firm, because stage by stage, let's say I'm doing your tiles, Steve, what do you get paid?","timestamp":"00:24:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"My tiles are done, so I can move to phase number two, then I can do my cabinets.","timestamp":"00:24:53"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"cabinets.","timestamp":"00:24:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"that later.","timestamp":"00:24:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Let's Let's go.","timestamp":"00:24:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"you.","timestamp":"00:24:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"The paint.","timestamp":"00:25:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So sometimes not asking for the payment on time, client thinks they can get away, will pay you.","timestamp":"00:25:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You mean you're not following up with the payments regularly?","timestamp":"00:25:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Correct.","timestamp":"00:25:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

because you stop busy trying to get the material, bring the material to the house, get the job, manage some and some contractors.","timestamp":"00:25:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"That slips away that, you know, you got to collect money.","timestamp":"00:25:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And by missing that, by missing that treasure, going to the next, to stage number two, client thinks, oh, it's okay, you can afford it.","timestamp":"00:25:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"We can pay after, we can pay at the end.","timestamp":"00:25:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And at the end, when it comes, like one job I did last year, I lost $24,000, they never paid me.","timestamp":"00:25:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:25:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And you're saying, and you think it's because, and I'm sorry, I guess, why do you think that's happening?","timestamp":"00:25:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Why do you think that this is happening like the way it is?","timestamp":"00:25:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I don't know.","timestamp":"00:25:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I just, I","timestamp":"00:25:56"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I for me, if I don't ask you for the money today, I'm thinking, I trust you, you give it to me tomorrow, or at end of the week, I don't know, but something's going to be set in place, say, phase one is done, let's collect, move to phase two.","timestamp":"00:26:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay, but are you, is it that you're just, like, unorganized, or you're not remembering, or, you know what I'm saying, like, that's why I'm asking, why do you think that it's happening, that phase one is coming, and then you missed the mark, and then you're going, into phase two, and then, like, why is that happening?","timestamp":"00:26:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I think it's more, I think it's more, more like, me trusting people that, you know, I forgot to ask for my payment today, or they should know that we finished, they should pay, but it's okay, you we'll get paid tomorrow, the day after.","timestamp":"00:26:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So, I think it's me, I look at this, actually, more, more, you know, I'm actually the problem, because I'm trying to do.","timestamp":"00:26:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"too many things at one time, and I said, it's okay tomorrow, it's okay tomorrow, I'm trusting the person, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.","timestamp":"00:27:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay, and so what do you think, I mean for you, what is a solution that you think to that, and what would it do for you?","timestamp":"00:27:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's what I'm trying to understand, like if you, like for example, if you are able to notify the person that you need the money, know what I I'm trying to understand in your mind, what you're thinking like, okay, here's my problem, and this is what I would need to solve it, you know?","timestamp":"00:27:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I think it's more of a, more of a, actually you said before, if I'm disorganized, maybe I think I'm not, but maybe that's my problem.","timestamp":"00:27:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Maybe I'm not organized, maybe I'm not organized a hundred percent, and I don't treat the business as a business.","timestamp":"00:27:45"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I treat the business as, you know, as a friend.","timestamp":"00:27:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay, interesting.","timestamp":"00:28:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I mean, I guess the big question is, what kind of effect do you think that that has on your business?","timestamp":"00:28:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Sometimes people won't take me serious.","timestamp":"00:28:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Yeah, I can't say that aloud.","timestamp":"00:28:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Because it feels a bit disorganized.","timestamp":"00:28:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Correct.","timestamp":"00:28:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Not disorganized because I don't care like I do.","timestamp":"00:28:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Disorganized because I

right?","timestamp":"00:31:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"That's idea, yeah.","timestamp":"00:31:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And for both of these, well, it sounds to me like for the pricing, you have a process.","timestamp":"00:31:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If you go to a customer, you do a walk around, you take some notes, you look at what they need, then you have to go home, figure out what all these instruments are that you need materials, and then you got to go online and look for the pricing.","timestamp":"00:31:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then you find the pricing, and then you're going to come back to your computer, you're going to draft up an email or something or a document and said, this is my proposal, this is the cost, X, Y, Yeah, a quote.","timestamp":"00:31:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You could probably break that down.","timestamp":"00:31:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But your payment, your payment problem doesn't seem to have a process.","timestamp":"00:32:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"No, it doesn't seem like you say to me, okay, every week, you know, when I'm done this phase, then I go to my computer, I do this part, I, you know, extract, I create this invoice, I send it over to this person, and then they get this invoice, and then I collect that payment.","timestamp":"00:32:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And then once I collect that payment, I move on to the next phase, like there doesn't seem to be a process there.","timestamp":"00:32:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It seems like I'm just working, and occasionally I'll send an email and say I need my money, and if they send it on time, I get it, if not, I keep working.","timestamp":"00:32:25"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So you end up actually bankrolling

involve","timestamp":"00:32:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Me, who I am as a person towards the project, and it's bad.","timestamp":"00:33:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And I'm just curious, like, how bad is this right now?","timestamp":"00:33:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like for you, like, how bad is, are these two problems?","timestamp":"00:33:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, are they ruining your business?","timestamp":"00:33:17"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or is it making things really difficult?","timestamp":"00:33:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So look at this right

it.","timestamp":"00:33:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So now this is probably, it's probably relevant to what we're discussing, but it gives you an idea.","timestamp":"00:33:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So we went and we had a couple of meetings, probably three, four meetings with the clients.","timestamp":"00:33:41"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"We

there is a good chunk of money left behind.","timestamp":"00:34:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So probably if you do,

$8,000.","timestamp":"00:42:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"We don't want, we don't want more than that.","timestamp":"00:42:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Because then it seems like you go in, try to gouge the people.","timestamp":"00:42:09"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And no, we want to come here and kind of put a good lipstick

too.","timestamp":"00:42:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So how can we build something to help with this?","timestamp":"00:42:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, I think that's the wrong

right?","timestamp":"00:50:01"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Who is your demographic of a person would be my question, and how many leads can you actively service?","timestamp":"00:50:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If you've got 100

for?","timestamp":"00:50:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"You've to keep it in mind, not every lead is a closed project,

at a point, you can pick and choose out of 100 leads, and you can say out of 140, and then from 40, you just pinpoint 10 of them.","timestamp":"00:50:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Well, you have to have a system to narrow these down, right?","timestamp":"00:50:43"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because you're going to have to have meetings, you're to have to have calls with these people, you're going to have to send

these leads.","timestamp":"00:50:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You have a list of leads, now how do you reach out to

is your system...","timestamp":"00:50:58"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I'm going to say your system, will it help us well with, let's say somebody calls.","timestamp":"00:51:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"He calls my number, I cannot answer, because I see a lot of BS on the internet and stuff like that, but will AI be able to answer the phone and schedule a meeting, an appointment with the client?","timestamp":"00:51:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Is that something that's included with what you do?","timestamp":"00:51:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, mean, what I do, I mean, I mean, I think that's the, I'm trying to get the clarity on it, like, all of these things that you're talking about, are all things that I can build for anyone.","timestamp":"00:51:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The question is, what do you need?","timestamp":"00:51:44"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

problem for","timestamp":"00:51:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because if you're like, hey, I want this, I don't know, I want something that really helps me with my, like entering calls, like, like you said, something that like, it's the phone and schedule calls from, and you build this whole thing, and you then realize that you're only missing like two calls a month or something like this, and what's the value in it, right, you're going to be like, yeah, that thing's cool, but I don't really use it, there's no value, right, and so the reason why I ask you, like, what is the biggest problem, because it's always about what is my main issue, because if that problem is solved, it will give me X, Y, or Z, yeah, what will that do for me, right, and so you've mentioned a lot of different things, like, can it answer the problem?","timestamp":"00:52:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I know, I'm a mess.","timestamp":"00:52:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What is your, what is your, how do I, how do I look at this?","timestamp":"00:53:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:53:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"The thing is, we started the conversation.","timestamp":"00:53:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It was interesting when you're like, I sit on a toilet and I have a lot of ideas, right?","timestamp":"00:53:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I don't  with ideas because ideas are not proven.","timestamp":"00:53:15"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They're not proven problems.","timestamp":"00:53:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like ideas are problems, the things that people have, and then you have to go and prove whether these are problems that people want to pay for.","timestamp":"00:53:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If valuable, yes or not.","timestamp":"00:53:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"If they're value, if they're real problems, right?","timestamp":"00:53:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's the end of the day.","timestamp":"00:53:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"People have real problems.","timestamp":"00:53:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"buy a solution.","timestamp":"00:53:33"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"What I'm interested in is like in the construction business, what is a real problem?","timestamp":"00:53:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because if that's a real problem, that's such a problem, it's quite likely that not only you have it, but 20, 30, 40, 50 other people that do exactly what you do have that same problem.","timestamp":"00:53:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"But you can approach that in many different ways.","timestamp":"00:53:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I mean, you know what?","timestamp":"00:53:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"You just put a fleece in my head because now I'm going to make a list.","timestamp":"00:53:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"I'm gonna go over and figure out, is this a problem?","timestamp":"00:54:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Yes, it's a problem.","timestamp":"00:54:04"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's not just about developing a system that can help you with the calls, with the reminders, with creating a budget, with maybe creating a lead generation.","timestamp":"00:54:06"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's even beyond that.","timestamp":"00:54:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"It's even, you know, labor, people, tradesmen, reliability, you know, we're at a point right now that this is why I'm by myself because I know if I say, Steve, I'm gonna come to your house, I will, and I'm gonna get it done.","timestamp":"00:54:31"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Maybe it won't take me two days, will take him three days, but I know I'm gonna get it done.","timestamp":"00:54:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So another biggest problem too is find people to work, find the right people to work.","timestamp":"00:54:52"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"and read that","timestamp":"00:54:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Right now we have a big issue with, and I don't disrespect nobody, we have a big issue with the illegal people.","timestamp":"00:55:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"They go and work for next to nothing, and they don't know nothing.","timestamp":"00:55:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And in the construction industry, it's a  show.","timestamp":"00:55:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"Okay.","timestamp":"00:55:16"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So what is the problem is that you can't find good skilled workers?","timestamp":"00:55:18"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You cannot find good skilled workers.","timestamp":"00:55:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

anymore.","timestamp":"00:55:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"The baby boomer happened, it's still happening.","timestamp":"00:55:29"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And everybody thinks, you know, I'm a jack of all trades.","timestamp":"00:55:32"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And I look at people laying tiles, and I say, you blind men, that's what you do.","timestamp":"00:55:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And they call themselves tile sitter, when we have to take courses and get diplomas.","timestamp":"00:55:40"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And they want top dollars for it.","timestamp":"00:55:48"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So that's, that's, that's, I think, that's the biggest problem of all.","timestamp":"00:55:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And I don't that's, that's not an AI.","timestamp":"00:55:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"No, I don't think so.","timestamp":"00:56:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I mean, I don't I don't think I can particularly solve it.","timestamp":"00:56:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But I do.","timestamp":"00:56:07"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I do.","timestamp":"00:56:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"It made me think about the question of whether whether training is a business and in your field, like whether construction training is a business, of course, can be a business.","timestamp":"00:56:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And that's what I was just thinking about, because because people what one thing A.I.","timestamp":"00:56:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

plumbers.","timestamp":"00:56:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You're going to need people that build stuff because

that.","timestamp":"00:56:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So, you know what, you should look at what's called A.I., they create a factory that the machines are building walls.","timestamp":"00:56:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"And what are they doing?","timestamp":"00:56:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"They put into a truck, they live into a job site, and instead of five, six carpenters, now you have two, maybe three carpenters that they got.","timestamp":"00:56:50"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"You the train, raise it up, bolt it in place, done deal.","timestamp":"00:57:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"So AI is actually taking over some stuff like that in

people to move it.","timestamp":"00:57:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Antonio","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"antonio@linbeccapital.com"},"text":"But you cut the people right in half.","timestamp":"00:57:14"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, I mean, the thing is, yes, I mean, we're getting into
