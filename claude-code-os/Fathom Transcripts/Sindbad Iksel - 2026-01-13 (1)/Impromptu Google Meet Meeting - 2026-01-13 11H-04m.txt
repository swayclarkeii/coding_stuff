more of a pie that you can target, right?","timestamp":"00:03:35"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Then there's, am I reaching enough of those people, right?","timestamp":"00:03:42"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And so, I would work backwards.","timestamp":"00:03:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"would work and say, I need to find out whether the offer that I'm giving people is enticing to them.","timestamp":"00:03:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Are people looking at my offer and thinking, , I need that pitch deck?","timestamp":"00:03:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or are they

now.","timestamp":"00:04:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I'll spend money on that later.","timestamp":"00:04:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And that's how you position it.","timestamp":"00:04:03"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's how you're positioning the product and how you're writing to them about the product.","timestamp":"00:04:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They trust you.","timestamp":"00:04:10"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"All of those things are like, you've got to find out, if I have a good offer, how many people buy the offer?","timestamp":"00:04:12"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Do you understand what I mean?","timestamp":"00:04:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Because if you start bringing more people in on this side and you're like, well, we need 3,000 people.","timestamp":"00:04:22"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"That's the problem.","timestamp":"00:04:26"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We need more leads.","timestamp":"00:04:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"And it's like, well, now you get 3,000 people, but they're getting the same offer and the offer doesn't work.","timestamp":"00:04:28"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"They're not, nobody's buying .","timestamp":"00:04:34"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:04:36"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So you got to make sure on a smaller scale, like, that's why I would go back and find out from these people with a feedback, how many, why didn't you buy this?","timestamp":"00:04:37"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Like, just let us know.","timestamp":"00:04:46"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I was too expensive.","timestamp":"00:04:47"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We don't really need this right now.","timestamp":"00:04:49"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Then you can find out, okay, they said they don't need it.","timestamp":"00:04:51"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"How do I make this thing?","timestamp":"00:04:54"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"So it feels like something they need.","timestamp":"00:04:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or the price is wrong.","timestamp":"00:04:57"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Hmm.","timestamp":"00:04:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Maybe.","timestamp":"00:04:59"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"We've got to lower our prices.","timestamp":"00:05:00"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Or, I just don't know who the  you are.","timestamp":"00:05:02"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Oh, well, maybe I'm just encroaching on people too quickly.","timestamp":"00:05:05"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"I've got to build up some more trust first before I sell them something.","timestamp":"00:05:08"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"You find out what that problem is, get some sales in, find out, ah, okay, this is what worked, and then you crank the  machine.","timestamp":"00:05:11"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah.","timestamp":"00:05:20"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"Right?","timestamp":"00:05:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Crank the machine before you know if you're even selling the right thing to the right people.","timestamp":"00:05:21"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Yeah, I love that.","timestamp":"00:05:27"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Richard

Brabin","matched_calendar_invitee_email":null},"text":"I'm going to, yeah, I'm going to hit that up for the next couple of weeks, I think, see where that goes.","timestamp":"00:05:30"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"My feedback or my advice to you on building that is you've got to make something that's super easy, like not crazy questions, super short, super easy, and super useful.","timestamp":"00:05:39"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"Right?","timestamp":"00:05:55"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway

get more leads, that's something I could potentially help with.","timestamp":"00:07:13"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"But I think you and Sinbad have a talk about it first.","timestamp":"00:07:23"},{"speaker":{"display_name":"Sway Clarke","matched_calendar_invitee_email":"swayclarkeii@gmail.com"},"text":"See if, like
