1. Purpose: Why Hooks Are More Important Than You Think

Definition: Hooks are the first 2-6 seconds of a short-form video. During the hook, a viewer is rapidly absorbing context (visuals + text + audio) and deciding whether or not to opt in and continue watching the rest of the video

Why are hooks so important? Funnel Math: The second a viewer churns off your video, nothing else that came after that point matters. So if you make a 55 second video and they churn at 30 seconds, then the last 25 seconds might as well have been a black screen. If you make a 55 second video and then churn after 4 seconds, then the last 51 seconds might as well have been a black screen. Because of this, the hook (first 2-6 seconds) matters exponentially more than the rest of the video The Bridge To Trust: As a business owner, your primary goal with content is to build 1:1 trust at scale. The more viewers that trust you, the easier it is to monetize. Hooks are the bridge that get a viewer to watch your video and begin to build trust with you. If a viewer does not cross that bridge, they will not watch the video, and that trust cannot be transferred. Hooks are a vital prerequisite for trust. Hooks Are Headline + Intro Wrapped In One: Short-form videos do not have headlines, subheaders, thumbnails, or titles. All other forms of content (e.g., YouTube videos, blogs, etc) have a summarized teaser or peek into what that piece of content will be about that helps you decide to opt in. With short-form videos, hooks are that teaser. All of the opt-in pressure is on the hook Choice Vs Reflex: With all other forms of organic content (TV shows, YouTube videos, emails, blogs), viewers choose to start consuming based on that Headline/Summary. Short-form videos are fed to the viewer automatically so they are forced to react with reflex to choose if they want to keep consuming. This means there is a higher number of people that start watching who might not have opted in to consume in the first place. Your hook has to be that much better to keep them.

No matter how important you thought hooks were, I promise you, they are more important than that. You should be spending 30-40% of your total video improving your hooks

2. Building Blocks: The 4 Hook Components & How To Maximize Alignment

Overview: In this section, I’m going to break down the 4 hook components and how to think about them as a single unit to maximize alignment.

Common Misconception: When most people hear the word “hook” they only think about the written script that is spoken on the video. This is called the Spoken Hook. But it turns out, the spoken hook is only 1 of 4 different hook components that all combine together to make up the full hook

The 4 Hook Components (in order of importance):

The Text Hook (what you write) The Visual Hook (what you show on the screen [either b-roll graphics and/or you as a-roll]) The Spoken Hook (what you say verbally) The Audio Hook (any non-spoken audio -> music and SFX) People can read and visually absorb faster than they can hear, so the visual and text hooks are consumed first (and matter more) than the spoken hook. This is why videos without any spoken audio can still perform well on their own, but spoken words with weak visuals/text rarely do.

The flow of viewer attention goes from visual/text -> spoken -> visual/text

The Secret To Winning Hooks (Max Alignment): The difference between 500 and 500,000 views is achieving max alignment across all 4 of these hook components If you say one thing verbally, but the visual shows something even slightly different, these elements are misaligned and the hook is less effective because of comprehension loss Comprehension is the degree to which the viewer actually understands what they are seeing and hearing. If your verbal spoken hook is different from the visual hooks, which is also different from the emotion in the music hook, they will be confused. Confusion leads to comprehension loss, which means it’s harder to get the hook to stick and the viewer to opt-in

Why is the Lifesize Floor Plan video and example of good hook alignment? Spoken Hook: “These are called Lifesize floor plans. You can literally walkthrough your exact home design before you build it. Visual Hook: Shows clips of people walking through floor plans of their home Text Hook: “Future of Home Design” // “Lifesize Floor Plans” Audio Hook: Chill music in background Assessment: The text/visuals perfectly complemented what I said in the spoken hook and further deepened the curiosity rabbit hole

Why is the Longshot space cannon video and example of bad alignment? Spoken Hook: “This company is sending shipping containers into space. But here’s the crazy part…they’re not using rockets. Instead, they’re building a space cannon to shoot them into orbit Visual Hook: Showing clips of space shuttles in space, and then a homemade PVC pipe cannon Text Hook: “Space Cannons Are Awesome” Audio Hook: Chill music in background // subtle SFX Assessment: My spoken hook was “sending shipping containers” but the visuals showed rockets in space. Slight disconnect. The text said “Space Cannons” but I didn’t really show a space cannon, I showed a makeshift pipe prototype that was hard to visualize blasting a shipping container up there

Takeaways on Hook Component Alignment You need to think about your hooks cohesively from the beginning. As you write your spoken hook, do you have a sense for what the text and visual hooks should be to be best aligned? If you don’t, there is a good chance you will have a misaligned hook in the edit In Section 6 (Hook Framework), I’ll break down the exact tactics for how to gut check alignment. For now, just have in your mind that a hook is the visual hook + text hook + spoken hook + audio hook (music/SFX) ---------------

3. Psychology: What Is Base Viewer Psychology & How To Engineer Hooks That Work Overview: In this section, I’m going to break down a viewer’s psychology as they consume a video and then explain how we can use that understanding to engineer winning hooks Psychology (core tenets): The only job of the hook is to get a viewer to “opt in” and keep watching. If this is accomplished, you win Key Understanding: All viewers are subconsciously seeking value when watching videos. That value can come in two forms: 1. Educational Value (useful) - this is a tactical piece of information (e.g., tips, frameworks, case studies, resources, etc.) that gives value by helping solve a painpoint to unlock some desire (e.g., I watched this video about taxes and it gave me a helpful resource for saving money by deducting my business expenses) 2. Entertainment Value (interesting) - this is a story that gives value by creating an emotional response against some interest (e.g., I watched this video about a murder mystery and it created a shocking and suspenseful emotional rollercoaster) Key Distinction: The point in this session is not to debate whether your content strategy should be to make educational or entertainment content…that is for another workshop around content strategy. Ideally you want your educational content to be entertaining, and one type of entertainment content could be in an area where the viewer also seeks education. Both can work individually, both can work combined. The important point here is that both types of content require the same psychology hook triggers to get a viewer to keep watching. So regardless of which you’re making, the following will apply To get a hook to “hook the viewer” you need to create an on-target curiosity loop related to the educational/entertainment value you’re delivering On-target - the topic covered is of interest (relevant) to the viewer Curiosity loop - some intrigue (typically from an unanswered question) is created in the viewer’s mind. The “loop” is the circular thinking of them continuing to guess as to what the answer is, get more info from you, guess again, get more info, etc. In layman’s terms…if the viewer is certain this video is about something they care about, and the hook opens an unanswered question or point of curiosity in their mind, they will stick around to find out more information…hoping to get an answer to that question. Now let’s breakdown how to engineer each of these two components…on-target and curiosity loop Engineering Hooks (Building Blocks) On-Target The question you should be asking yourself here is this…“How do we ensure that we are properly communicating what this video is about, so the viewer can assess if it is on-target for them or not?” On-target -> they stay Unclear/confusing -> they usually bounce (the worst case is when your video would have been on-target but your hook was confusing so they never gave it a chance) Off-target -> they bounce We communicate on-target with a combination of rapid context, clarity, distillation, and comprehension In order for a viewer to understand if this video is about a topic they care about, you need to tell/show them what the video is about as soon as possible. This is called rapid context. I recommend communicating this in the first sentence. Imagine this is the first sentence of my spoken hook…

Ex 1a: Spoken hook: “Guys, this story blew my mind, you’re never going to believe this.” Text hook: CRAZY STORY Visual hook: Girl on screen talking in bedroom Audio hook: N/A

[If this is your first hook sentence, you are betting the entire video on the viewer opting in because they know you. Because the hook itself gives the viewer zero other context on the topic target. The girl is the message and messenger]

Ex 1b: Spoken hook: “If your skin looks like this in your 30s, you might have a problem.” Text hook: Skin Tips for 30 y/o Visual hook: Girl on screen in bedroom, leaning in to camera and pointing to acne on cheek Audio hook: N/A

[In this case, you can tell the topic is skin health for people in their 30s. Right away you have some information to decide whether to stay or bounce. The girl is the messenger, skin health is the message]

While context is what we say, comprehension is how effective the words/visuals were at communicating the point we were trying to make. Did the viewer actually understand you? Your goal is to use the fewest words/visuals (distillation) that make the clearest point (clarity) to maximise comprehension The biggest reason why viewers fail to assess if a video is on-target for them (topic confusion) is because they misunderstand the words or alignment of words/visuals used in the hook. This is comprehension loss…they literally lose understanding. And this happens when you use words they don’t understand or match them with a visual that is unclear Another hack for making a video hook feel more on-target is to increase direct relatability. And this means using the word “you/your” instead of the words “me/my/I” Saying “you” makes the viewer feel like you’re speaking directly to them, which increases the feeling that this video is on-target for them. Saying “me/I” forces the viewer to have to decide if they see themselves in you. This temporary paralysis drives comprehension down If the viewer doesn’t feel like the topic of the video is for them, they will bounce. We can’t decide what the viewer is interested in, only communicate clearly enough for them to decide if our video is in that set Tactics (to increase viewer understanding of topic): Use short, simple words to increase clarity Use the minimum amount of words to increase distillation Use “you/your” instead of me/my/I to increase relevance and relatability Say what the video is about directly by giving rapid context in the first sentence Do everything you can to increase the overall comprehension of the words you say. If you read the first few sentences, and you think they could be comprehended in multiple ways, then you need to rewrite the sentence as it could cause confusion. The goal is unmistakable clarity

Which of these hooks is clearer?

Option 1: I got tons of new customers when I improved my storytelling Option 2: If you want to improve your storytelling, these 3 guides are a goldmine

You might think option 1 is optimal because it’s shorter and references proof for why the following tips are effective at storytelling.

But there’s two problems here:

First, I have to decide if I see myself in this creator and/or if the customers he/she is referencing are in the same category as the customers I want (relevance question) This sentence in a vacuum could be comprehended several different ways and create pause in the viewer’s ability to reflexively opt in: Is the next sentence going to be about storytelling tips or a story for how they used them? I don’t know yet, and therefore I am hesitant

Compare this to the second option which is much harder to misunderstand and feels like it’s for me. After just hearing that sentence, I’m extremely clear that I’m about to get guides about storytelling, so I can more easily opt in with confidence.

Curiosity Loops

The question you should be asking yourself here is this…“How do we ensure that we open a curiosity rabbit hole for the viewer to go down?” The best way to create curiosity is by setting up contrast. Contrast is the most powerful psychology concept in all of content What is contrast? Contrast is the distance between reality and expectations. Expectations is what someone currently believes (common belief) and reality is what you suggest/tell them in the video that differs from that existing belief (contrarian take) The bigger the distance between expectations and reality, if used on a topic the viewer cares about, the more hooked they will be Here are a few additional examples breaking down why contrast is so powerful and how it maps to making a video useful/interesting…. Ex 1: If I believe all apples to be red, and so does everyone else in society…but then I see a purple apple, the first one ever…that is pretty curiosity inducing It’s interesting because I haven’t ever seen a purple apple before….no one has The contrast between all red apples and a single purple one is large, but if I see the 1000th purple apple, all of a sudden the purple apple is no longer interesting. Because the contrast between my purple apple and the 1,000 other purple apples is null Ex 2: If I believe all CEOs wake up at 4am to start working, but then I meet one that says they wake up at noon everyday and still have a $1B+ company…that is pretty curiosity inducing The fact that someone wakes up at noon is not interesting in isolation But the contrast between what I believed to be true (all CEOs wake up early) and the new reality offered (this CEO wakes up at noon and is successful) is what makes it interesting Ex 3: If Prince Charming in a story is walking in the forest on a horse…that isn’t curiosity inducing But if a dragon comes out of nowhere and starts attacking the Prince, all of a sudden things get interesting… Is the dragon fighting the prince interesting on its own? Kind of…but what ratchets up the interestingness is the change in state…the contrast, between walking calmly and fighting the dragon Contrast = interesting = curiosity How does contrast show up in a hook? There are two ways to create contrast with the words in your hooks…Stated Contrast or Implied Contrast Contrast can either be created by comparing two stated things or by introducing a new thing that is different from the implied baseline

Ex: (Stated Contrast): “If you want to save money on your taxes, stop putting money in your 401K. Instead open a smart-yield harvest account…it’s what all the rich people are doing to save 6-figures per year”

[In this case, the 401K approach is the common belief. We are stating it directly to put an anchor in the ground that this is the baseline we are comparing against. The smart-yield harvest account is the contrarian reality…this is a tactic that we know but others don’t. The contrast between the two is what creates intrigue (if someone cares about taxes]

Ex: (Implied Contrast): “If you want to save money on your taxes, use a smart-yield harvest account. This is the biggest hack rich people are using to save 6-figures per year”

[In this case, we never stated the common belief, other than to imply that it was anything but using the smart-yield harvest account. This leaves the contrast comparison a bit more up to the viewer to “create” their own baseline]

The stated contrast decreases the chance of comprehension loss or confusion, but it’s usually more specific and may rule out potential viewers. The implied allows you to relate to more people. Both work depending on the circumstance Tactics (to increase curiosity loop): Figure out what contrarian take/reality you have on the topic that others don’t have. This can either be a legitimately new piece of information or a different angle/take on the same information Understand what the common baseline expectation on the topic is that most viewers have Create either a stated or implied contrast in your spoken hook by building a comparison between the baseline vs your contrarian reality Let’s go through a couple quick examples to break down how this works in practice…

Ex 1 (Sleep Tech | Entertainment Video)

Spoken Hook: “This headband is going to revolutionize the way we sleep. It’s called the Elemind. And the people that use it fall asleep way faster than normal”

Text Hook: Magical Sleep Headband

Visual Hook: Broll of people putting on the headband and falling asleep with it on

Breakdown: On-target: In the first line of the spoken hook, I was extremely clear to explain that this video is about a headband that would change the way we sleep. This communicates to the viewer that the video will reference tech and sleep. If you’re interested in either tech and/or sleep, you can opt-in after just 1 line. I also had a strong text hook “Magical Sleep Headband” which further added clarity First contrast: In the first line, I also subtly included a small version of implied contrast. I said, “revolutionize the way we sleep” which suggests that this headband (contrarian reality) would be different from the implied baseline (everything else). The text hook was helpful here as well Second contrast: In the third line, I directly created a huge contrast moment by saying, “the people that use it fall asleep way faster than normal.” This is an example of the stated contrast…my contrarian reality is falling asleep faster and the common baseline was normal. The visual hook of the people sleeping with the headband on also accentuated the point I was making that the headband helps people fall asleep faster The combination of these contrasts (me alluding to a device that lets you sleep better) and the topic clarity (tech and sleep) make it impossible for a viewer to not fully understand what this video might be about and curious enough to stick around and watch

Ex 2 (Content Strategy | Education Video)

Spoken Hook: “Steal these viral hooks” [singing]

Text Hook: 7 Viral Hooks (written on whiteboard)

Visual Hook: A guy holding a whiteboard with cardboard taped over words as he tears them off one by one

Breakdown: This is a brilliant example of communicating both the on-target clarity and the contrast in just 4 words On-target: By saying “steal these viral hooks” he’s both communicating there is something worth stealing and that the video is about viral hooks for content. If you make content and want better hooks, this video might help you. The text hook also states this explicitly…perfect alignment Contrast: In this case, he’s using implied contrast. His contrarian reality is that he has hooks that are proven (because they’ve gone viral) and the common baseline is that you don’t. If you make videos and want more virality (which is everyone), you’d be interested in this because of that contrast. The visual hook (hiding the hooks under cardboard) is also a bonus of creating more allure in that the secret is just a few seconds away

Summary Reminder:

To get a hook to “hook the viewer” you need to create an on-target curiosity loop related to the educational/entertainment value you’re delivering On-target - the topic covered is of interest (relevant) to the viewer Curiosity loop - some intrigue (typically from an unanswered question) is created in the viewer’s mind. The “loop” is the circular thinking of them continuing to guess as to what the answer is, get more info from you, guess again, get more info, etc.

4. Hook Structures: The Database of Winning Hook Structures Overview: In this section, I’ll walkthrough a full hooks database to reference when writing with different hooks. Every example referenced, came from a top 15 video on that creator’s channel (this means the style has been validated by at least 1 person in a major way)

Database Approach: My goal in this session is to give you the one-stop shop for hooks development Your approach should be to look at each hook component bucket like a box of legos and each option or way of doing things is a different shaped piece. When making hooks, you want to take a piece from each section and stack it together until you find a winning formula The easiest way to find a winning formula is to copy the proven style from people in your niche. In Section 5, I’ll show you how to do that research process to find new/other hook legos that I haven’t included here

As we know, hooks boil down into 4 main components: Spoken Hooks Visual Hooks Text Hooks Audio Hooks

What I’ve done is ordered every option in each category from easiest (top) to hardest (bottom) to execute. Your goal is to find the easiest path that works and matches with your desired personal brand aesthetic.

Spoken Hooks Structures: Fortuneteller: Create curiosity loop comparing the existing present to a new future because of something that happened Ex: “This backpack is going to change how people hike in the future” Experimentation: Create curiosity loop by framing a practical pain point being solved through an example/experiment you’re showing/doing/discovering live Ex: “You can pack more hiking equipment in your backpack, if you just do this…” Educational/Tutorial: Create curiosity loop by framing a practical pain point being solved through an example/method/tool that you are teaching Ex: “If you want to fit more in your backpack, use the 2-1-3 method” Secret Reveal: Create curiosity loop by revealing a secret, hidden truth, or finding that you came across Ex: “There’s a backpack brand nobody knows about but all the celebrities are wearing” Contrarian/Negative: Create curiosity loop by immediately stating a non-obvious belief in first line Ex: “People spend way too much time obsessing over their backpack design” Comparison: Create curiosity loop by comparing many versions of something “Ex: These are the top 5 hiking backpack brands…but which one is actually best for long trips?” Question: Create curiosity loop by posting a question they’re interested in learning the answer to Ex: “Why are so many people wearing this backpack when they go hiking?”

This can be done in combination with one of the above: Raw Shock: Create curiosity loop by hitting them with an instant scroll stop word/action/sound and/or telling them to explicitly to look at something Ex: “See this bag…”

Spoken Hooks Delivery: Synced with visual - the spoken audio is recorded live by the person on screen as they are talking Unsynced with visual - the spoken audio was recorded after the fact and visuals laid on top

Visual Hook Structures: Visual Selection Creator A-roll - visual is full screen shot of creator talking to camera Creator in B-roll - visual is full screen shot of creator doing something silently (typically audio is recorded separately) Subject in B-roll - visual is full screen shot of someone doing something (not creator) (typically audio is recorded separately) Non-subject B-roll - visual is full screen shot of something that isn’t a person Examples - graphics are visual examples (other videos, photos, etc.) Image Screenshots - visuals are still images Article screenshot - visuals are screenshots of articles Arrow/Highlights - visual have arrows/circles/highlights on top of them to direct attention

Visual Movement A-Roll (who’s talking) None Slow zoom Quick zoom Crazy Transition B-Roll (non-talking) None Quick Cuts Swipe Transitions Text Overlays Slow zooms 3D effect Layout Structures Full screen A-roll (in studio) Full screen A-roll (in world) Full screen A-roll (partial graphic overlay) Full screen B-roll Full screen B-roll w/ A-roll overlaid (greenscreen/circle) Split screen A-roll + B-roll

Text Hook Structures: Word Structures Base Captions (repeat of spoken words) [X subject] does [Y thing] Future of [X thing] [X shocking thing] Visual Layout Plain Text Text with Shadow Text on Colored Background Text Written On Physical Prop Motion Text appears Text swipes in from side

Audio Hook Structures: No audio (zero music, zero SFX) Music only (music backing track with no SFX) SFX only (no music backing track with SFX) Both Music + SFX

Like I said at the beginning of this section, the goal here is to put all the cards on the table for what components winning hooks use.

This isn’t meant to overwhelm you, rather give you a library of options to try and experiment with.

5. Hook Research: The foolproof research method for finding and validating winning hooks

Overview: In this section, I’m going to walk through the full research process you can use to learn how to identify hook patterns and blueprints to replicate in your own videos

Approach: The truth is, most people are not going to start with a Notion database when trying to come up with a fresh hook. It takes way too long and most aren’t as applicable to their niche The goal is to use these resources as a way to train your brain to see patterns so that pulling from them becomes second nature

Niched Hooks Research: If I were starting from scratch today, this is the exact research process I would use to find viable hooks that specifically apply to my niche. And these are best because they have been proven to work for my IVA

Process (btw, is going to make this whole process super easy, launching in ~4 weeks) Build a Creator List of 20-30 accounts in your niche that specifically target your IVA. You’re looking for people that have at least 50K followers, have posted at least 50 times. Where to find them If you care about this space, you likely have at least one in mind. Pick them, go to their “Following” and scan this list. You should find 20 more. If you are truly starting from scratch, open a fresh account (new email), begin typing niche-relevant search terms in the search bar, start scrolling and liking posts from people that are on-topic. In 15 mins, your Explore feed will be full of them Once you have that list, keep it in a note Go to download chrome extension. You may need to pay for premium ($40) Pull up the first creator on the list. If on Instagram, go to the Reels tab, open Sortfeed. Filter for the last 200 videos (proxy for the last 12 months) and sort by views. You will now be able to see the videos ranked by views Right click, open in a new tab, analyze the hook used. Specifically, you’re looking for any hook that caught your eye and you want to document what about it caught your eye (in the context of the hook component buckets that I broke down above). In aggregate, you’re (Optional) Duplicate the Notion Database I linked above and fill out these rows accordingly

I would run this process across your entire Creator List every 2-4 weeks to continue assessing what is working now that wasn’t before.

6. Framework: The 10 Minute Framework For Writing Winning Hooks From Scratch

Overview: In this section, I’m going to give you a 5 step process to use when you’re writing hooks that will ensure they perform better. The goal is that every time you make a hook, you run through this process

General Strategy & Approach:

Your hook process should be the following (in this order) 0. Understand the visuals you already have (sourced broll) Maybe you found some other footage that can be a visual for you. Maybe you’ve recorded a clip of yourself in the past that you think works here. If you have something good to use, you might want to build your hook around that (ex for the sleep headband video, I knew I had clips of the headband and people sleeping with it so I could say “This headband…” If you don’t have any great visuals at this stage, no worries, you’ll create the visual in a minute. This step is just a gut check 1. Write the spoken hook (full process below) Pick one of the hook structures that best fits your topic (ideally has been validated in your niche) or try to write your own Write the 1-4 line hook on a doc 2. Identify the best visual to show on the screen that complements that spoken hook If the topic is about something where there is a clear visual to add comprehension, use it If not, 3 options… Go shoot full screen b-roll on your iphone to reflect the action you think best complements what you’re saying Generate full screen graphics using AI tools Use a full screen video of yourself saying it (Creator A-roll). Know that this will put more emphasis on your text hook 3. Write the text hook (that will show on screen) If you don’t plan on using a visual hook (because the main visuals are just Creator A-roll, the text hook must be dialed) You’ll add this in the edit 4. Record video Make sure to record multiple takes if the visual hook is going to be only Creator A-roll 5. Editing hook… Imagine all viewers’ eyes can only look at a single spot on the screen at once. Have you used visuals and text in a way that ensures they are seeing the text and visual hook the way you want them to? When you watch the hook back, ask yourself these questions? Are you hooked? [sounds dumb, but if you aren’t hooked, why would they be?] Are you clear on what the video is about? Are you curious enough to want to keep watching? Are you bored or locked in?

HOOK WRITING CHECKLIST

Step 1: Hook Strategy & Process Reminder This step is easy and will take you 3 seconds to do I want you to actively remind yourself that your hook is comprised of 4 main parts: Spoken Hook Text Hook Visual Hook Audio Hook

Step 2: Write Spoken Hook Easy Mode -> pick a validated spoken hook structure from the database/research and copy Normal Mode -> write spoken hook from scratch 1. What is the context I need to communicate about this video so the viewer can decide to opt-in? 2. What is the contrast between what they currently believe and what I believe that I can use to get them interested? Can I communicate both of these things in a single sentence? If no, take 2 sentences (Examples below) The best spoken hooks are ones that build the most contrast. What does “the most contrast mean?” If you have 100 people in a room and ask them what they believe on your topic. If 100 believe one thing, and you are the only one that believes the other, that is max contrast. If 50 believe one thing, and 50 already know the thing you’re going to say, this is less contrast When delivering the audio: Speak with good pace and energy Make sure the audio is clean and high quality. If you have heavy echo or a low monotone voice, this will impede performance Fewer words is better, but use additional words if it helps decrease potential misunderstanding If you trip up over your words, do it again

Step 3: Write Text Hook Easy Mode -> pick a validated text hook structure from the database/research and copy Normal Mode -> write text hook from scratch The text hook needs to elicit curiosity and ideally, an emotional reaction (of shock/surprise) Use the fewest words possible Make the font as big as you can without being overwhelming on screen Make sure it is easy to read when overlaid on the visuals. Cheat code for this is to use white or colored background behind it so it pops more Use a font that’s super easy to read Keep the text hook as close to “eye level” of subject as possible without blocking something important Don’t have text hook and make sure the text hook is visible when post is seen in feed

Step 4: Build Visual Hook Easy Mode -> pick a validated visual hook structure from the database/research and copy Normal Mode -> build visual hook from scratch You want the visuals to have enough motion and color that it captures attention. A black and white image, unless animated, won’t hold anyone. The brain reacts subconsciously to color and motion If using Creator A-roll The more attractive and happy you look, the better (I don’t make the rules) Try including some initial motion and/or passive action while delivering the hook line Initial motion could be something like you starting with the camera close to you and then leaning away slightly Passive action is called “Pope in the Pool.” You do something passively while explaining something else. For example, doing your makeup while talking. The action of the makeup is just enough to hold base attention so that people stay focused If using any other B-roll Make sure attention is flowing where it needs to in order to understand the visual (using arrows, circles, different colors can help with this) - Switch the visuals every 1-2 seconds. Every time the visuals change, it stuns the viewer into resetting for 10-20ms. If you do this too aggressively for them to comprehend each visual, they will be visually confused and bounce. You need to find the right sweet spot High contrast, high color, high motion in the visuals is best

Step 5: Edit Hook When you’re editing the hook, you’re looking for 2 things: Comprehension (via alignment) - when you watch it back, do all hook components feel aligned, easy to comprehend, and effectively create a curiosity loop? Pacing - is the pacing (spoken speed + visual switching) fast enough to hold attention? Final Check exercise: When we watch the video on silent, are we clear on the stated topic + curiosity loop? When we listen to the video with our eyes closed, are we clear on the stated topic + curiosity loop? When we watch and listen with sound, are we clear on the stated topic + curiosity loop?

If you run through this checklist as you make your hooks, you can’t lose.

7. Examples: Breaking down winning/losing hooks from creators & brands across many different niches

Good Hook (12M views) Spoken hook: “Why do some people squat like this, and others like this. Which form is correct?” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: Shows A vs B squatting and illustrates squat angle Explanation for why this hook performed well Immediate context is that this video is about squat technique (perfect visual match) Curiosity loop/contrast -> compares two forms of squatting; anyone that has squatted is comparing both to themselves and curious which is right/better Bad Hook (90K views): Spoken hook: “In my opinion, for natural lifters, a body fat of 12-15% is the most sustainable physique” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: Creator doing a deadlift, shifts to a shirtless pic Explanation for why this hook flopped Wasted space with “In my opinion” -> most valuable real estate used Context was clear the video would be about body fat, but unclear what I would get out of it besides his opinion Contrast wasn’t clear because the take was that 12-15% is best, but there is no comp. This negates the curiosity loop because of confusion Better option would have been: Bodybuilders make it seem like 6% bodyfat is normal. But if you want to look fit year round, 12-15% body fat is the best target. Here’s how to get there in 6 weeks”

Marketing Agency: ("https://www.instagram.com/brian_blum/") Good Hook (320K views): Spoken hook: “Malbon Golf made $30M last year by following this unique content strategy called T.D.S.” Text hook: Malbon Golf ($30M Content Strategy), “Unique Content Strategy” Visual hook: Shows cinematic images of Malbon’s content (switched viewing angles). Explanation for why this hook performed well Immediate context is that this video is about to share a content strategy that was effective in building a $30M brand Comprehension was maxed and hook components aligned perfectly

Bad Hook (20.7K): ("https://www.instagram.com/brian_blum/reel/DIhwHGkt21Z/") Spoken hook: “Here’s how this hot sauce sold for $82.5M and saved a media company from financial collapse. Here’s how they pulled off the great content marketing heist of the decade” Text hook: “How Hot Ones built a $82.5M Empire by Entertaining 1st, Selling 2nd” Visual hook: Clips from hot ones (hot sauce circled), $82.5M in text, marketing 3 piece funnel graphic Explanation for why this hook flopped The points here felt disconnected. Hot sauce selling. Media company collapse. Content marketing heist. They all tie together once you watch the piece, but when that’s all you see, you’re a bit confused where it’s going Visually, there was a bit too many different things going on to know where to look Title text was too long and not on screen for long enough so couldn’t read it Better option would have been: Hot Ones just sold this hot sauce for $82.5M. But here’s the wild part…their entire show was a genius content strategy designed to get celebrities to endorse it for free.

Social Media/Content Creation: ("https://www.instagram.com/rico.incarnati/")

Good Hook (1.5M views): ("https://www.instagram.com/rico.incarnati/reel/CzmAWhTRA0i/") Spoken hook: “Instagram’s rolling out a huge update. Here’s everything you need to know.” Text hook: “Instagram’s New Update (Watch This…)” Visual hook: Creator in house, 2 angles, text comes on screen and bounces Explanation for why this hook performed well Immediate clarity on value for who should watch and what you might get out of it. This video is about new changes to IG, if you make content you will want to know Curiosity loop is peaked. If you care about this stuff, you are going to want to stick and see what he has to say Contrast is comparing not knowing to knowing

Bad Hook (17.4K): ("https://www.instagram.com/rico.incarnati/reel/DHj-qfLRLPX/") Spoken hook: “ChatGPT, I know showing up online is the key to growing my business. I know my next client is probably watching and just waiting for me to say the next thing, but I keep hesitating…” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: Split screen (creator A-roll on top, chatGPT graphic on bottom) Explanation for why this hook flopped This is a classic “me” hook, where the creator is saying things framed from their perspective. This forces a viewer to try and guess if the upcoming value would be for them. Most churn Pace is extremely slow Context is unclear Better option would have been: “If you struggle with overthinking, watch this…”

AI Automation Agency: ("https://www.tiktok.com/@adamstewartmarketing")

Good Hook (1.6M views): ("https://www.tiktok.com/@adamstewartmarketing/video/7276440256579226898") Spoken hook: “I’m gonna show you how you can create videos from simple prompts in seconds” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: Creator A-roll (slow zoom) looks off screen as it transitions Explanation for why this hook performed well Super clear and impossible to misunderstand. Anyone who watched the first line is 100% clear what they’re getting Contrast is that wasn’t possible to do this before, now it is

Bad Hook (2.3K) Spoken hook: “What if I told you I created their entire website in just 30 seconds?” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: Full screen into Split screen (creator A-roll on bottom, poor website on top) Explanation for why this hook flopped The website he showed in the image doesn’t look impressive at all (which devalues any curiosity that was formed) The hook implies he’s going to explain that he did create the website, but it isn't crystal clear that he might explain how. After 1 sentence, you’re still not sure what you’re going to get. Better option would have been: “People are building entire websites, like this one, in 30 seconds” (key is that the visual websites have to actually look good)

DTC Product (AI studying tool)

Good Hook (14M views) Spoken hook: None Text hook: “4 years of studying and I just found this…BRUH” Visual hook: Creator holds post-it note of text hook and then demos product, teacher in background Audio hook: Uplifting music is key here Explanation for why this hook performed well Super clear that the video is about some study trick for students Creates huge curiosity loop gives stakes of studying for 4 years Peekaboo effect of lesson playing in background helps bridge from hook to beyond

Bad Hook (700 views) Spoken hook: AI voice: “I saw this guy trying to watch our 4 hour lecture before class” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: In-world broll opening door to lecture hall and walking over to student cramming Explanation for why this hook flopped The AI voice sounds fake, the pacing and intonation make it hard to hear exactly what’s being said The framing of the sentence, “cramming to watch the 4 hour lecture before class” doesn’t make sense. You can’t both cram and have it be 4 hours. Confusing. There is no contrast to the potential solution until the 3rd sentence…speed to value is slow Better option would have been: “My friend just showed me how to cram for class”

Podcast Clip:

Good Hook (3.5M views): Spoken hook: “I’ve interviewed 100s and 100s of people and I’ve never met someone who has the perspective on life that you have. You are truly unique” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: 2 angles of creator, then blurry -> fixed of guest Audio hook: Uplifting music is key here Explanation for why this hook performed well Context is immediately clear that something will be revealed about this person that is rare and unusual The contrast is embedded in the entire frame, “I’ve interviewed hundreds and you’re unlike all of them”

Bad Hook (350K views): ("https://www.instagram.com/steven/reel/C83wnoSgk4e/") Spoken hook: “I’ve seen patients cooking a meal in their sleep, who’ve driven in their sleep, committed crimes in their sleep. So what is the story of Kenneth Parks?” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: Visuals of guest, cutting 3 times across 2 different angles Explanation for why this hook flopped The connection between the points is unclear and so contextually, a viewer has no idea what’s going to come next The effect of sleep on patients only matters to the viewer if they see themselves in the patients Better option would have been: “If you go to bed past 11, you’re going to have a really hard time succeeding”

Personal Brand (Business):

Good Hook (4.4M views): ("https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKCr9nVOPwH/") Spoken hook: “If you make fake scenarios in your head before you go to sleep, it’s a sign of mental illness.” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: A roll of creator to Broll Audio hook: Uplifting music is key here Explanation for why this hook performed well Context is immediately clear that the creator is going to share some insights around why creating fake scenarios before sleep (something many might do), is a problem The curiosity loop here is built by contrasting people that do this vs people that don’t and what it might mean

Bad Hook (60K views): Spoken hook: “The economy’s about to tank and here’s everything you need to know” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: Visuals of creator, pointing to money on screen, pointing back to him flexing Explanation for why this hook flopped The link between saying “the economy is tanking” and him flexing makes no sense, so it’s confusing for the viewer to understand what they’re about to get in the video Better option would have been: Same spoken hook but a different visual to reflect the economy tanking…possibly the movie clip from Wolf of Wall Street when the market tanked or a broll clip of the creator that fits more with the message (emotion sad/scared)

Wellness Clinic: ("https://www.instagram.com/drjolenebrighten/")

Good Hook (916K views): Spoken hook: “When women are on the pill, they’re attracted to, genetically, someone who’s more like their cousin” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken) Visual hook: Clip of creator talking Audio hook: Uplifting music is key here Explanation for why this hook performed well Context is immediately clear that the creator is going to explain some medical finding about women when they take birth control The curiosity loop comes from contrasting women attraction on and off birth control

Bad Hook (18K views): ("https://www.instagram.com/reel/DA_GhL8xMfJ/") Spoken hook: “What can you do? Support your local farmer and have conversations with your farmer” Text hook: “How to create a better food system and have better access to food” Visual hook: Creator talking to camera (A-Roll) Explanation for why this hook flopped The creator tried a question and answer style where the text hook poses the question and the spoken hook starts immediately with the answer. The problem with this is that someone needs to first read the text hook to have context on what the spoken words are about, and by the time they do, they are lost and confused There is no curiosity loop or contrast here Better option would have been: “If you want more access to better food, you need to talk to your local farmer”

Mortgage/Real Estate:

Good Hook (1.4M views): ("https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGRt4WmPI7z/?hl=en") Spoken hook: “There’s a concept called the short-term rental loophole, and it’s funny because there are people last year who would have earned $10K/month, who this year will be paying absolutely nothing in tax” Text hook: “Reduce your taxable income to $0 with the STR Loophole” Visual hook: Clip of creator talking off screen (fake podcast style) Explanation for why this hook performed well The spoken hook is a bit long-winded but it matches perfectly with the text hook. If someone were to get bored as the spoken hook sentence develops, they shift their attention to the text hook, read it, and then lock back in on audio Contextually, it’s immediately clear the creator is talking about a way to save taxes using the STR loophole The contrast between paying some vs no taxes is stark and so curiosity is high

Bad Hook (43.8K views): Spoken hook: “As a society, we’ve been pulled apart. And I think housing affordability being so tough, presents a new opportunity, which is bringing families back together again. Text hook: “Hack to make it easier to buy a home.” Visual hook: Creator talking to camera (A-Roll), switch to full-screen B-roll, back to creator Explanation for why this hook flopped The spoken hook was delivered in a roundabout way. It was hard to decipher what the point is of this video, other than to hear the creator’s general take. The text hook didn’t match the spoken hook. The text hook was “hack to buy home” while the spoken hook was “we’ve been pulled apart as a society Combined with the visual hook jumping, it was hard to read text and follow speech Better option would have been: “If you want to buy a home, but you can’t afford it, do x”

Design Agency

Good Hook (1M views Spoken hook: “The long-low shelf or cabinet is such a hack in design” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken hook) Visual hook: Split screen, creator showing static image on top half Explanation for why this hook performed well The spoken hook is super clear and gives context for what the video will be about “long-low shelf” and why it improves design The visual hook matches the spoken hook perfectly which closes the loop on context and opens one on curiosity (what about it works so well/should I get one)?

Bad Hook (41K views): ("https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI4jDkHICzO/") Spoken hook: “We’ve been working on this front room and needed a coffee table that fit perfectly. Text hook: Captions (same as spoken hook) Visual hook: Creator A-roll, quick flash of image from front room Explanation for why this hook flopped The spoken hook was decent, but the lack of the visual of the front room on screen really hurt. Context was clear in the sense that he was looking for a coffee table, but the full context wasn’t delivered because a viewer couldn’t visualize the room beyond the single second it was on screen. If he would have left the image on screen, or even added a quick cut of a couple, this video would have 2-3x’d easily Better option would have been: Same spoken hook, image longer on screen

Tech/AI: ("https://www.instagram.com/kallaway/")

Good Hook (14M views): Spoken hook: “These are called Lifesize Floor Plans. You can literally walk through your exact home design before you build it” Text hook: Lifesize Floor Plans Visual hook: Split screen, Full B-roll with creator overlay, arrow pointing to room Explanation for why this hook performed well The spoken hook, text hook, and visual hook were perfectly aligned and shockingly different from anything anyone had seen before The curiosity loop was huge

Bad Hook (34K views): Spoken hook: “One of my favorite new brands right now is Huega House. They have a bunch of athletes and celebrities wearing them, which is huge” Text hook: “Viral Content Ideas: Clothing brands” Visual hook: Split screen Explanation for why this hook flopped The spoken hook was a classic “me” problem and didn’t give the viewer any context for why they should stick around and watch the video There was no curiosity loop or context Better option would have been: “Here’s a content idea that would blow up a clothing brand”

Storytelling: Good Hook (1.1M views): Spoken hook: “For the past month, I have been in one of the biggest slumps of my life” Text hook: Captions (same as spoken hook) Visual hook: Full A-roll with creator Explanation for why this hook performed well The spoken hook and visual hook felt aligned. He said he was in a big slump and was laying in a messy room which suggested a big slump The spoken hook and premise was extremely relatable. This is one where even though he spoke from a “I/me” vs “you/your” perspective, it was largely relatable to anyone watching that was struggling

Bad Hook (39K views) Spoken hook: “Something I’ve really learned the power of in the last year is thought habits” Text hook: “ AM, March 20, 2024” Visual hook: Creator B-Roll with voice over Explanation for why this hook flopped This hook flopped for two main reasons The visual, text, and spoken hooks were completely misaligned. The visuals showed the creator getting dressed in his room, the text hook said a time/date, the spoken hooks talked about something called “thought habits.” There was no connectivity between those and so it wasn’t compelling to stay The hook was framed in a me/I and introduced a confusing concept “thought habits” that people might not have understood. Comprehension loss -> disinterest Better option would have been: “All you need to do in order to be success is master your thought habits”

8. Q&A

Is there a “too salesy” line for hooks you shouldn’t cross? The only goal with hooks is to get the viewer to want to keep going. If you sell, but they don’t see incoming value, they will bounce. If you push hard (super salesly) but you’ve framed it in a way where the predicted value exceeds the push, they’ll stay. The answer is more about how much expected value is incoming How does IG differ from Tiktok or YouTube Shorts? Good storytelling is good storytelling regardless of where you post. Viewers cannot outrun their own psychology on any medium. The best hooks will work everywhere without needing a change. That being said, one of the better approaches to content strategy (a separate topic) is to remix off of proven formats that already work in your domain or your given platform. There are differences across optimal formats on Instagram vs Tiktok, so I would customize the visual approach accordingly Can you share some mindset or self-help hooks that aren’t cheesy? This framework always works, “If you want to improve [X problem], do [Y thing] To add more context…self-help isn’t the thing that is cheesy. What’s cheesy is the delivery of the value trigger. If you make the promise/reward of the content feel compelling and not too good to be true, you won’t have a cheesiness problem Can I get your take on reaction video hooks? Reaction videos are essentially just surfing on top of videos that have already been validated. These work well because the hooks are already optimized. I think this is a super strong format that seems to work in every niche. The con of doing only reaction videos is that the trust accrued to the remixing creator (you in this case) will be stunted a bit, given that the value per second that came from you is less than it could be. This may be worth it if you get 100x the views What AI tools do I use to create visual hooks? Text to Image: Midjourney, ChatGPT 4o-Image Text to Video: Google Veo 3, Krea AI, Runway ML Watch this video for how I use different AI tools in the content workflow How to turn dry facts/numbers/stats into good hooks? Lead with the painpoint someone is experiencing and/or the reward state they want to achieve and then use the stat to help amplify the importance of listening. Stats are not dry if they justify that the incoming solution is more valuable than the viewer originally thought How to gut check your hook even if it looks good to you? Either have a friend that is in the target avatar group watch the video and gauge their reaction Make 4 different hook variants and A/B/C/D test them all using something like IG Trial Reels The truth is, unless you copy someone else’s validated hook 100% exactly, you can’t know with certainty that your hook will work. You need to be willing to make the video, post it, and then if the hook doesn’t work, remake the video again with a new hook a few weeks later Who should be the one speaking in the hook? If you’re trying to accrue personal brand value to a single individual, you want that person to be on screen as much as possible without losing the viewer’s focus If a vacuum, you want the most attractive, most relatable (given background) person you can possibly find (e.g., a fitness creator that is ripped will have more traction than one that isn’t) What data do you look at to evaluate if a hook is working? The best thing to look at is average watch time. If average watch time is higher than average, the hook was more effective than normal. This will also coincide with more views and usually better scores in every meaningful metric What type of hooks work for physical products? Show the outcome (or emotion from the outcome) that the video subject gets when using the product
