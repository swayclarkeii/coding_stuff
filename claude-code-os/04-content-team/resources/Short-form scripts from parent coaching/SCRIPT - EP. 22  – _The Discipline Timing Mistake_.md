This ONE timing mistake is SABOTAGING every discipline attempt you make with your kids.  
Most parents do this BACKWARDS.   
Your kid does something wrong, you get triggered, they're crying and dysregulated, and you think this is the PERFECT moment to drop a life lesson on them.

But THINK about it.

Would you teach a kid math during a MELTDOWN? Would you study for the bar exam after a HUGE fight with your bestie?

Of COURSE not. So why do we think kids can absorb lessons when their brains are in FIGHT OR FLIGHT?

It's RIDICULOUS. We're trying to download wisdom into a brain that's completely IRRATIONAL.

But here's what messes with our heads \- we think if we DON'T discipline right now, we've LOST our chance.

They're going to forget, RIGHT?   
Reality check: Studies show kids as young as THREE remember things for days, even WEEKS.   
The lesson WILL land.

Better example:   
You get terrible news about something you messed up, you're DISTRAUGHT.   
Your partner starts with, "Hey, you know what you should do BETTER next time?"

EXACTLY. Without even a back rub, you AIN'T trying to hear that.

Do I teach during a meltdown? NO.   
During an argument? NO.   
Right after? NO.   
While they're figuring out Captain Squash rules? HELL NO.

They're NOT hearing you. You're just that ANNOYING adult.  
I stopped disciplining before asking: Are they READY to hear anything?  
If NOT, I wait. Maybe later today. Tonight. Maybe DAYS.

Truth is, we can't wait because WE'RE caught up in our emotions. We NEED to feel useful.

If you want your kids to ACTUALLY listen and learn,   
try these THREE things:   
CONNECT with them.   
VALIDATE what happened.   
WAIT for the calm.

Your kids aren't trying to drive you CRAZY. They're learning to be human and humans learn BEST when calm and ready.

Next time you're about to drop wisdom on your dysregulated child, ask:   
Are they READY? If not, WAIT for calm. Your relationship DEPENDS on it.

If you're stuck and need connection scripts? Hit me in the DMs.
