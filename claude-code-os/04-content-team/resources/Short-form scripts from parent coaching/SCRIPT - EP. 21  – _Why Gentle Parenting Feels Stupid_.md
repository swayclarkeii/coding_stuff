There's a reason gentle parenting feels so STUPID when you do it.   
It's because your nervous system thinks you're ENDANGERING your child.

Here's what I mean: When you validate your kid's emotions instead of shutting them down, your nervous system thinks PREDATORS ARE APPROACHING \- like letting a stranger comfort your crying child. 

CRAZY, right?

Look, let me show you what I mean.

Your childhood programming, what therapists call TRAUMA RESPONSES, says: Children should be SEEN, not HEARD.   
Gentle parenting says: Let them EXPRESS all their feelings.

Your programming: You want me to give you something to CRY ABOUT?   
Gentle parenting: Big feelings are NORMAL and VALID.

Your programming: Because I SAID SO, that's why.   
Gentle parenting: Let me explain why we can't have GOLDFISH CRACKERS for dinner.

Trust me, I feel like an IDIOT saying half of this stuff, but here's what HELPED me: 

When I feel that THIS IS STUPID feeling creeping up, I literally say out loud, “Hey nervous system, I SEE you trying to protect me, but we're SAFE.   
And It stops me from SHAMING MYSELF.

Look, research shows that your child's big emotions trigger what experts call FAMILY GHOSTS \- it's where your nervous system literally makes you feel like a POWERLESS CHILD again instead of the ADULT you are.

It's NOT your bad technique, and you're NOT a bad parent.   
It's just your nervous system making gentle parenting feel PHYSICALLY WRONG even when you KNOW it's right. 

So give yourself PERMISSION to feel stupid while you reprogram.   
It's WORTH IT.   
You're breaking GENERATIONAL PATTERNS here.
