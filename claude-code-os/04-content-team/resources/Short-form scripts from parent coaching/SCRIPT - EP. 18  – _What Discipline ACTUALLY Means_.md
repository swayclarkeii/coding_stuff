I thought discipline meant punishment. Then I learned the REAL definition \- and it COMPLETELY changed how my kids respond to me.

Last week, my daughter was caught destroying property at kindergarten.

First reaction? FREAKING pissed.

Then I took a breath and remembered what discipline ACTUALLY means.

Discipline doesn't mean punishment. It means TO LEARN, whereas punishment doesn't teach learning. It teaches the OPPOSITE \- fear.

She's four. Doesn't understand property destruction. She's not bad \- she's JUST unskilled.

Old me: "You're not riding your bike EVER AGAIN."

New me asks myself questions BEFORE I do anything:   
What do I want her to learn?   
How can she learn it?   
And when is she ready \- when she's wound up or when we're BOTH calm?

The whole point is guiding behavior.   
Want to guide behavior?   
Need cooperation. Want cooperation?   
Need receptivity. Want receptivity?   
Need comfort. Want comfort?   
Connection FIRST.

NONE of that happens when you're punishing.

But what DOES happen?   
Kids get afraid, resentful, they hide stuff.   
You get into a cycle \- hide, punish, more scared, MORE hiding.

So that night after dinner, we were both calm. "Hey, what happened today?"

She opened up. Wasn't perfect, but she was OPEN to learning.

I know what you're thinking \- she got away with it. HELL NO. She felt guilt. I didn't need to pile on. She KNEW she messed up.

I grew up afraid of my father's presence and REFUSED to repeat that. So for me, this new way teaches them WITHOUT the fear. I can't go back \- punishment feels way TOO risky.
