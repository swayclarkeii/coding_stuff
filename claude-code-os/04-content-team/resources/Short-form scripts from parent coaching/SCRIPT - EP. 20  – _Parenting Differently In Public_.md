A mother told me she shows TOTAL compassion when her 4-year-old wets the bed.

BUT when she shoves another kid off the swing? She LOSES IT.

Here's what's REALLY happening: You're not parenting your child \- you're MANAGING YOUR REPUTATION.

When her daughter wets the bed: "Oh sweetie, accidents happen. Let's get you cleaned up."

BUT when she shoves another kid off the swing: "What is WRONG with you? We've TALKED about this\!"

SO I asked her: "What changed between bedtime and playground time?"

Same kid. Same developing brain. Same LACK of impulse control.

BUT here's what I think changed \- the AUDIENCE.

No one's watching when she wets the bed. BUT at the playground? Other parents are judging OUR parenting.

SO our child becomes "DEFIANT" instead of "DEVELOPING."

That 4-year-old's skill level didn't MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR between bedtime and playtime.

BUT our compassion did \- the moment our REPUTATION felt threatened.

Same patience you show when she's learning to WALK... where does it go when she's learning to REGULATE EMOTIONS?

She can't control her bladder AND she can't control her impulses when overwhelmed. BOTH require the same thing: patience while her brain develops.

SO next time you respond differently to similar behaviors, ask yourself: "Am I responding to my child's need... or MY TRIGGERS?"

Because here's the TRUTH \- kids don't change.   
AUDIENCES DO.
