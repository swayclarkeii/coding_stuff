If you want your kids to actually LISTEN to you instead of the constant power struggles,   
stop being their BOSS and start being their COACH.

Most parents default to the boss approach \-   
laying down the LAW from above, demanding immediate obedience.

But here's the PROBLEM with that.   
When you control through punishment,   
you're teaching kids that whoever has the most POWER wins.   
So guess what they do on the playground?   
I noticed this when I saw my daughter constantly yelling at her little brother \-   
she was just MODELING me.

That's why I switched to coaching.   
And here's the CRAZY part \-   
when you STOP trying to control them, they actually start listening MORE.

You gotta think like a COACH.   
So what do they do?   
FIRST, they gauge their player's current skills before jumping in.   
SECOND, they're more involved when their players are learning   
and more hands-off as they IMPROVE.

So in our case, instead of "Stop hitting\! Go to your room\!" try THIS:   
Get down on their level and say:   
"I can see you're upset about your toy.   
And when you're mad, you can say I was using that.   
Let's PRACTICE that."   
Then let them practice the words.

Yes, this takes more TIME, and may not work the first time,   
but it's worth it in the long run. 

Because your job isn't to CONTROL their every move \-   
it's to DEVELOP their abilities. 

Coaching builds internal motivation and keeps your relationship STRONG. 

Try this the next time you get into it with your kids \-   
you'll be SHOCKED at how differently they respond.
