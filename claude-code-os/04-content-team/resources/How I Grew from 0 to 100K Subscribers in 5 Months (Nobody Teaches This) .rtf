\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 00:00 i just hit 100,000 subscribers on 00:02 YouTube 0 to 100K in just 5 months and 00:06 here's the truth i did not follow the 00:08 conventional wisdom some things yes but 00:10 along the way I figured out a bunch of 00:12 new tactics that really sped this 00:14 process up so in this video I'm going to 00:16 break it all down these are my nine 00:18 biggest nonobvious lessons for going 00:20 from 0 to 100K on YouTube and if you 00:23 want to grow faster you're going to want 00:24 to watch this video all right lesson 00:26 number one is absolutely critical this 00:28 is the biggest reason why I was failing 00:30 YouTube before so many people get this 00:32 wrong the most important factor for 00:34 winning on YouTube is making videos for 00:36 a super precise audience profile i call 00:39 this audience matching you want to match 00:41 your content with the same audience over 00:43 and over and over let me explain what 00:45 this means to grow on YouTube you need 00:47 the algorithm to put your videos in 00:49 front of the right people this is 00:51 obvious but here's what's not obvious if 00:53 you help the algorithm find these people 00:55 it will push your videos to more of them 00:57 and you will grow faster if you make it 00:59 harder for the algorithm to find these 01:01 people it will not push your videos and 01:03 you will grow slower so it's critical 01:05 that you help the algorithm get 01:06 confident in knowing who to push your 01:08 videos to okay so what does that 01:10 actually mean if you make 10 videos in a 01:13 row about science the algorithm is 01:14 pretty confident that video number 11 is 01:17 going to be about science that means it 01:19 knows exactly who to push video number 01:21 11 to people that want to watch videos 01:23 about science this is an example of a 01:26 good audience match all the videos are 01:28 aligned for viewers that want to watch 01:30 science but here's the problem the more 01:32 you jump around to different types of 01:34 videos on the same channel the worse it 01:36 is so you make one video about science 01:38 and then you make a video that's more 01:39 about tech and then you make a video 01:40 about career paths as a scientist and 01:42 then you make a video vlogging where you 01:44 kind of do science stuff but kind of 01:45 don't these seem the same but they're 01:47 actually all targeting very different 01:49 audience profiles in other words the 01:51 type of person that would find value in 01:53 each of those videos is not the same 01:55 there's some overlap but there's also a 01:57 lot of difference so if you do this the 01:59 algorithm gets really confused it has no 02:01 idea what your next video is going to be 02:03 and so it doesn't know which of those 02:05 subsets to push it to and when that 02:07 confidence is down the algorithm pushes 02:09 you less the click-through is lower your 02:11 videos don't do as well and you grow way 02:13 slower this is an example of an audience 02:15 mismatch if your content audience fit is 02:18 misaligned your channel will not grow 02:20 and I know this because my first YouTube 02:22 channel which literally has an interview 02:24 with me and Mark Zuckerberg is a dead 02:26 channel nothing I post is going to grow 02:28 on there and that's because I tried 02:29 making tech videos but I also tried 02:31 vlogs and these content breakdowns and 02:33 entrepreneurial blueprints all four of 02:35 those video types were actually kind of 02:37 good but the targeting on that profile 02:39 was all over the place and this is the 02:41 really important part the reason I tried 02:43 to make all of those different types of 02:45 videos is because I made the critical 02:47 mistake of assuming that the game was me 02:49 making videos about the type of stuff 02:51 that I liked because I assumed that if 02:53 people subscribe to my channel for me 02:56 then all the different stuff I liked 02:57 they would like and this is a massive 02:59 massive flaw in logic because here's the 03:02 brutal truth people are not watching for 03:04 you they're watching for them they like 03:07 you as the messenger but they're 03:08 primarily there for the message whether 03:11 it's motivation inspiration tactics 03:13 comedy entertainment they watch your 03:15 stuff because they're getting something 03:17 out of it for themselves so by making 03:19 four different types of videos for four 03:21 different audience profiles across four 03:23 different sets of needs you're actually 03:25 alienating all of them and worse the 03:27 algorithm doesn't know which of the four 03:29 to push to next to grow on YouTube you 03:32 need the algorithm to be really good at 03:33 finding new people that are not 03:35 currently subscribed to you and the 03:37 easiest way to help it find those people 03:39 is for every single one of your videos 03:41 to be super valuable for the same 03:43 audience profile all right so what does 03:45 all this tactically mean for you how can 03:47 you take this and tweak your strategy on 03:49 YouTube let me lay it out exactly when 03:51 you're starting your channel you need to 03:53 start out with the audience not the 03:55 topic imagine your audience is a single 03:57 person one individual who are they what 04:00 are the sets of problems or interests 04:02 that they're interested in solving you 04:04 need to make videos week after week 04:05 after week for that one person and if 04:08 they truly are your dream viewer and you 04:10 truly make videos that help them there 04:12 are likely going to be thousands of 04:13 other people exactly like them that the 04:15 algorithm will go find for you for 04:17 example on this channel I make videos 04:19 for entrepreneurs that are trying to 04:21 grow faster with content to build bigger 04:24 businesses this has always been my focus 04:26 every single video I make has been for 04:28 that exact same audience entrepreneurs 04:30 for that exact same purpose to grow 04:31 their business in the exact same way 04:33 with content on social media and because 04:35 I've been so militantly narrow from the 04:38 beginning the algorithm has gotten 04:39 really really good at helping me find 04:41 more of those entrepreneurs if I make 22 04:44 videos in a row that resonate super 04:46 deeply for this audience then the 04:47 algorithm is pretty sure that number 23 04:49 is also going to resonate deeply and 04:51 because of that it pushes my stuff more 04:53 now the worst thing I could possibly do 04:55 now that I have that algorithm focused 04:57 and trained on 23 videos in a row is 05:00 violate that consistency with some 05:02 random video i think of this audience 05:04 matching phenomenon kind of like playing 05:05 a form of internet darts the more you 05:08 throw darts at the same board the bigger 05:10 and bigger the target gets it gets 05:12 easier and easier for you to hit it this 05:14 increasing of the board is the algorithm 05:16 helping you but if you throw one dart at 05:18 this board a second dart at that board a 05:19 third dart at this board all the boards 05:21 start getting smaller because the 05:23 algorithm doesn't want your offtarget 05:25 darts messing up the board once you pick 05:26 an audience avatar you're allowed to 05:28 experiment wildly with different types 05:30 of formats think of those like different 05:32 shapes of darts but you need to be super 05:34 narrow and disciplined with the audience 05:36 focus the board you throw to and here's 05:38 the last thing I'll say on this to prove 05:40 to you how important this is on this 05:42 channel i made my biggest video about 05:44 storytelling that just hit 1 million 05:46 views well I posted that exact same 05:48 video on the Zuck channel literally the 05:50 exact same video and it was capped at 05:52 1,700 views same video wrong avatar 05:56 audience mismatch all right now lesson 05:58 number two is super counterintuitive and 06:00 this will save so many of you when you 06:02 start a YouTube channel your intuition 06:03 is that when you make a video you want 06:05 to post and share that video on all your 06:07 other social platforms to get people to 06:09 come watch it you'll tweet about it 06:10 you'll put it on Instagram stories 06:11 you'll make a LinkedIn post do not do 06:13 this it is crushing your YouTube growth 06:16 and let me explain exactly why think of 06:17 every social media platform like a 06:19 highway the viewers on those platforms 06:21 are driving cars at different speeds so 06:23 short form videos like the Audabon let's 06:25 say it's 90 mph twitter is maybe 75 mph 06:29 youtube is maybe 50 m hour people 06:31 watching YouTube have their brains 06:33 clocked at 50 m hour that's what normal 06:35 looks like to them so when they see your 06:37 video come up organically on the YouTube 06:39 home feed and they click it the speed 06:41 and delivery and pace is kind of exactly 06:43 what they're expecting to watch but when 06:45 you post about a YouTube video on 06:46 Instagram reels or story some other 06:48 platform this takes someone who's 06:50 driving at 90 mph and forces them to 06:53 immediately ramp down to 50 this is a 06:55 mismatch from what their baseline is is 06:57 and so what happens is they click they 06:59 go to the YouTube video they watch for 07:00 30 seconds and then they bounce cuz it 07:02 wasn't the consumption pattern and speed 07:04 that their brain was clocked at now 07:06 maybe they churn because the speed was 07:08 too slow maybe they churn because they 07:09 didn't have the full 15 minutes to watch 07:11 the YouTube video but whatever it is 07:12 they churn and this sends a super 07:15 negative signal back to the YouTube 07:17 algorithm because the algorithm is only 07:18 evaluating your video on really two 07:20 factors one is click-through rate how 07:22 many people click the thumbnail and get 07:24 to the video and two is average view 07:26 duration how much does an average viewer 07:28 actually watch of your video when 07:30 someone clicks your link from Instagram 07:31 stories or any of those other platforms 07:33 you don't actually get credit for the 07:35 click-through rate because they never 07:36 clicked the thumbnail they went straight 07:37 to the video and then their average view 07:39 duration is super short 30 seconds or 1 07:41 minute because of the miles per hour 07:42 problem so it's actually a double 07:44 negative that you do not want and this 07:46 double negative nukes the metrics 07:48 because it signals to the algorithm hey 07:50 don't push this video on the homepage 07:51 people are clicking and not liking this 07:53 is a disaster for growth so the question 07:56 is what should you do how should you 07:58 approach this and the answer is you 07:59 should do nothing personally I have 08:01 800,000 followers on Instagram Tik Tok 08:04 Twitter Snapchat LinkedIn all the other 08:06 platforms not a single one of them knows 08:09 that I post videos on YouTube because 08:11 YouTube wants people that like YouTube 08:13 to keep liking YouTube and keep watching 08:14 YouTube so I figured let's just let 08:16 YouTube do its thing i don't want to 08:18 cloud the algorithm with anything it's 08:19 good at finding people if you stay 08:21 aligned to my point before so let's just 08:23 let it do its thing in a way this trains 08:25 the algorithm that all of the work is on 08:27 it to grow the channel and it's actually 08:29 really good at that now if you just 08:30 can't help yourself you have this huge 08:32 following on social media you're brand 08:34 new on YouTube you really want to tell 08:35 people you can do it but absolutely do 08:37 not post a link take a screenshot of the 08:39 thumbnail put that thumbnail on stories 08:41 or tweet about it make people go into 08:43 YouTube search your name in the search 08:45 bar find that thumbnail and click it 08:47 even though their viewer duration might 08:49 be low because the miles per hour issue 08:50 at least you get credit for the 08:52 click-through rate which helps one of 08:53 the two metrics now I will say the only 08:55 cross-platform content medium that does 08:57 work well to share your YouTube links is 08:59 email and the reason why is because 09:01 while YouTube is at 50 m hour email is 09:03 more like 20 m hour and people are 09:05 willing to go from slow to fast they're 09:07 not willing to go from fast to slow and 09:09 so if you want to help grow and you have 09:11 an email list sharing your YouTube links 09:12 in email can actually be a huge help by 09:14 the way before I keep going you can 09:16 probably tell I don't really think about 09:17 content the same way as everybody else 09:19 if you like the way I think about this 09:20 stuff I've got two other things in the 09:22 description for free that you're 09:23 probably going to like the first one is 09:24 called Virality Blueprint and this is my 09:27 approach to dissecting how virality 09:29 actually works it's a 5-day email series 09:31 you can subscribe below completely free 09:33 it's at viralitybloopprint.com and the 09:35 second thing is I write a weekly 09:36 newsletter about this stuff where I 09:38 share these kind of hidden gem 09:40 behind-the-scenes tactics that I don't 09:41 talk about on YouTube that's called 09:43 content department you can subscribe to 09:45 that at content.game all right let's 09:47 keep going now the third lesson is to 09:48 understand how the psychology of being a 09:51 small channel works and how viewers 09:53 actually perceive you here's how social 09:55 media and content psychology really 09:57 plays out people will more freely click 09:59 and stay on your profile once your 10:00 following passes a social credibility 10:03 line let's say that line is 2,000 10:05 subscribers so what actually happens is 10:07 if you only have 200 subscribers or a 10:09 video with like 64 views people may see 10:11 your title thumbnail and actually get 10:13 intrigued but then they'll look and see 10:15 the small subscribers or small views and 10:17 they'll think twice before clicking it's 10:18 sad but this is the reality of how it 10:20 works as a small channel this is why 10:22 it's so much harder to get that escape 10:24 velocity initially because there's just 10:26 a lower percentage of people that are 10:27 willing to give you a chance what you 10:29 need to do is find a way to get to that 10:30 social credibility line so that any 10:32 random viewer will give you a max 10:34 opportunity and this line varies from 10:36 niche to niche and format to format but 10:38 on YouTube I think it's about around 10:40 10,000 subscribers now there are two 10:43 pathways to get there the common path 10:45 which is what most people have to do is 10:46 just hammer videos consistently and kind 10:49 of step up 100 to 200 subscribers at a 10:51 time over and over and over building up 10:53 until you get to 10K and like I said 10:55 this is really common that hockey stick 10:57 graph there's a reason that flat part 10:58 lasts so long that's just how long it 11:00 takes now the uncommon path which to be 11:03 honest few people get to experience is 11:04 to have some lucky viral outlier if you 11:07 get one of these it'll bring in 11:09 thousands or tens of thousands of people 11:11 overnight and it will rush you right up 11:12 to and above that social credibility 11:14 line and to be fair hitting that viral 11:16 jackpot doesn't make you rich it just 11:18 means that for every video after that 11:20 point every person's going to give you 11:22 the max chance to watch it now the big 11:24 question everybody wants to know is how 11:26 can I engineer the viral hit and the 11:28 easiest way to do it is with what I call 11:30 a quality shock it's not actually about 11:32 what you're saying in the early stage 11:34 it's more that the package of your 11:36 overall video is so shockingly good 11:38 relative to how small you are that 11:40 people subscribe almost as like a tip of 11:42 the cap and to be honest the only way to 11:44 engineer this predictably is to have 11:46 pretty advanced video skills from the 11:48 beginning which is fair not many people 11:49 have so the way to get this uncommon 11:51 lucky viral outcome it's either a 11:53 quality shock or it's just pure luck now 11:56 I'll be honest with you on this channel 11:57 I was fully planning on the grind it out 12:00 strategy 100 to 200 subscribers at a 12:02 time it was going to take two years i 12:04 was settling in for that and I was 12:05 investing in the team before i just got 12:08 lucky with the ladder that I had a viral 12:10 hit for mine I actually had two viral 12:12 hits back to back my fifth and sixth 12:14 videos on this channel ended up at a 12:16 million and almost 200,000 views but 12:18 I'll be transparent that was my 25th 12:20 long form video that I tried and my 12:22 300th video total between long and 12:24 shorts i had thousands of hours in front 12:25 of the camera thousands of hours editing 12:27 there's a lot that goes in behind the 12:29 scenes to create the lucky overnight 12:31 viral hit so I'm just being transparent 12:33 i was planning on not even having one 12:34 but I got lucky that I had two back 12:36 toback all right the next three lessons 12:38 are going to be super tactical about the 12:39 three most important parts of the videos 12:41 themselves but then after that I'm going 12:43 to break down a few of the mindset hacks 12:45 that were really really critical and 12:46 helping me keep going okay now the 12:48 fourth lesson you may have heard before 12:49 but I've got a few unique learnings on 12:51 it the truth about YouTube is that it's 12:53 not really a game of who can make the 12:55 best videos it's more of a game on who 12:58 can get the most people to click on the 12:59 right title thumbnail and then validate 13:01 that click in the intro it's frustrating 13:04 but YouTube the video platform is 13:06 actually a packaging game because the 13:08 best-in-class click-through rates are 13:10 like 10 to 12% so that means 9 out of 10 13:12 people that see your thumbnail will not 13:14 click on it 90% of the potential viewers 13:17 that could have watched never even 13:19 watched now as someone that came from 13:20 mastering short form first this was 13:22 super hard for me to accept cuz with 13:24 short form there is no packaging there's 13:26 no title there's no thumbnail ideas 13:28 still matter a ton but the short form 13:29 feeds just surface your videos 13:31 automatically to people so you don't 13:33 even have to think about packaging 13:34 here's a couple of the quick hit 13:35 learnings that I picked up about YouTube 13:37 packaging that will help you on YouTube 13:39 you really shouldn't start making the 13:41 video until you have the title and 13:42 thumbnail relatively dialed for titles 13:45 they should complement the thumbnail and 13:47 literally bait a click not clickbaity in 13:49 the schemy way but you need people to 13:51 click on the video to watch it usually 13:53 this is by describing their dream 13:54 outcome or a painoint in the title that 13:57 you're going to solve for the thumbnail 13:58 you should follow the three item rule at 14:00 max you should only have three things on 14:02 the thumbnail maybe it's you maybe it's 14:03 a couple words in text and then maybe 14:04 it's a graphic that's it anything small 14:06 they're not going to see anything 14:08 complex and detailed they're not going 14:09 to see and here's another tip that 14:10 people don't talk about a lot the 14:12 emotion on your face in the image 14:14 matters a ton you want the emotion on 14:16 the facial expression to match the tone 14:18 of the title or the tone that a viewer 14:20 should experience when they're reading 14:22 the title this is actually super 14:23 underrated matters a lot so let's take 14:25 the packaging example of this video I 14:27 made on hooks the title is how to create 14:29 irresistible hooks and blow up your 14:31 content and we specifically use the word 14:33 irresistible because that's what people 14:35 want they want content that people have 14:36 to watch they can't ignore then we added 14:38 the and blow up your content as a 14:40 modifier at the end to be really 14:42 explicit on exactly what you're going to 14:43 get out of the video now the thumbnail 14:45 has three elements in this case it's me 14:47 and then it's two different text 14:48 graphics one of the graphics says the 14:50 hook and the other one says storytelling 14:52 masterclass we specifically use the word 14:54 masterclass to exude quality and that 14:56 there was going to be some depth in the 14:58 video combine that with kind of the 15:00 mischievous little smirk I have on my 15:02 face my eyes are open but I'm kind of 15:03 smirking it just gives this sense that I 15:05 know what I'm talking about using the 15:07 word masterclass having the big word 15:09 hook and then that smile on my face 15:11 meeting with the irresistible hooks it 15:13 just combines in a way that's really 15:14 really tough to resist clicking now if 15:16 you guys want I'll make a full video on 15:18 YouTube packaging thumbnails and titles 15:19 in the future there's so much more to go 15:21 into i just can't cover it now just 15:22 leave a comment let me know all right 15:24 now the next lesson is talking about 15:25 intros and hooks and the non-obvious 15:28 lesson that I didn't know is that click 15:30 confirmation is critical to winning on 15:32 YouTube this is the first 10 to 20 15:34 seconds of the intro right after they 15:36 click it's when their urgency to solve 15:38 that painoint is highest they click on 15:40 the thumbnail they're most excited what 15:42 are you delivering in that 10 to 20 15:43 seconds to confirm that what they 15:45 clicked on is what they're getting cuz 15:46 if they don't see that it'll feel like a 15:48 bait and switch and they'll bounce now 15:49 fortunately for me because I made all 15:51 those short form videos and the topics 15:53 I'm making YouTube videos on are content 15:55 strategy psychology and hook frameworks 15:57 I have a deep deep mastery of how to 15:59 actually do this so I could crack this 16:01 pretty quickly i've made other videos on 16:03 this i'm not going to talk about it 16:04 again here but I have a formula that 16:06 crushes YouTube hooks and intros every 16:08 single time i actually put it together 16:09 in a template that you can just use and 16:11 fill in the blanks if you want that 16:12 there's a link below it's completely 16:14 free now the signature lesson here is 16:16 that if you want to make a hook that 16:17 actually hooks them and holds them you 16:19 need to create contrast against some 16:21 common belief so common belief is what 16:23 they think today your contrarian take is 16:26 something you know about solving their 16:28 pain that's different from what they 16:29 believe the distance between common 16:31 belief and contrarian take is contrast 16:33 if you frame this contrast explicitly in 16:35 the hook you will hook them and if you 16:37 can aim that hook at a pain point they 16:39 have well then they're going to watch 16:40 the whole thing all right lesson number 16:42 six is on differentiation what can you 16:44 actually do to make your videos cut 16:46 through and stand out against everybody 16:48 else well here's the first piece when I 16:50 make a video I'm trying to make the best 16:52 video ever made on that topic period 16:55 like I really really hold every video to 16:57 that standard and when I say best what I 16:59 really mean is the highest value density 17:01 in other words how much value is a 17:03 viewer going to get every single minute 17:05 that they're staying on my video like so 17:07 far in this video I've dropped six to 10 17:09 super tactical things that you can use 17:11 to grow YouTube faster and moving 17:12 forward from this point I have another 17:14 four to five that are buried the rest of 17:15 the video so I'm not holding anything 17:17 back this is as much value as I possibly 17:20 could pack into this topic the easiest 17:22 way to cut through and differentiate is 17:23 to approach your videos in this same way 17:25 now the truth is in order to do this you 17:27 have to have something valuable and 17:29 different to say and what do I mean by 17:31 this if you're trying to be an expert it 17:33 helps if you're actually an expert in 17:34 the topic this means proof that what 17:36 you're saying is actually going to work 17:38 if you don't have proof it's much harder 17:40 to get somebody to rationalize why they 17:42 should trust what you're saying for 17:43 example if I make videos on content 17:45 growth but I've never actually grown 17:47 with content before well then what good 17:49 is my take it's going to be super 17:50 generalized instead of starting on 17:52 YouTube you should spend all that time 17:54 actually building up that skill of value 17:56 coming up with an interesting take and 17:58 then start making content on YouTube now 18:00 there are three different ways you can 18:01 differentiate on YouTube one is in 18:03 uniqueness so that's what you say two is 18:06 in the distillation which is how you say 18:08 it and then three is in the explanation 18:10 so the examples or metaphors that you 18:12 use to explain your points you really 18:14 shouldn't start on YouTube unless you 18:15 have a clear hypothesis for how you're 18:17 going to be different and more valuable 18:19 across at least one of those three axes 18:21 and I'm telling you it's so much easier 18:23 to win when you actually have proof that 18:25 you can do the thing you're teaching if 18:26 I would have started doing this around 18:28 content without proof it would have been 18:30 so much harder to grow and I probably 18:31 would have quit because I wouldn't have 18:32 grown now the good news is if you 18:34 actually do have differentiated skills 18:36 and expertise you're going to crush on 18:38 YouTube because the bar is so low for 18:39 people that actually have that all right 18:41 now lesson number seven is a big one 18:43 this was a huge reason for my success i 18:45 hired a professional YouTube team from 18:48 day one i'm going to explain exactly how 18:49 I did that and why it helped so much 18:51 youtube is a 40 hours per week game if 18:54 you never tried it it will shock you how 18:56 many man-hour it takes to actually 18:57 produce videos of this quality 18:59 consistently i would not recommend 19:00 starting on YouTube unless you're going 19:02 to go allin with every hour you have or 19:05 you fund it with a professional team to 19:07 hire yourself out of the process it is 19:09 so much easier to cash flow somewhere 19:11 else and then put that cash in to hire a 19:13 YouTube team this is actually why I 19:14 recommend most entrepreneurs should 19:16 start with short form on Instagram and 19:17 Tik Tok cash flow quicker and then use 19:19 that cash to go allin on YouTube now 19:22 YouTube boils down to five main roles 19:23 there's ideas and packaging thumbnail 19:26 design script writing recording and 19:28 editing for me I was terrible with the 19:31 ideas terrible with packaging couldn't 19:33 do graphic design so had trouble with 19:34 thumbnails and hated editing i felt like 19:36 my strategic advantage was the script 19:38 writing the storytelling and the 19:40 recording and that's the part that I 19:41 didn't actually get frustrated with and 19:42 I was willing to do over and over so I 19:44 took the areas where I had gaps and then 19:46 I built the Avengers for YouTube i have 19:49 an ideas team that literally does all 19:51 the research on the space finds the best 19:53 ideas comes up with the titles hands me 19:55 the thumbnail design in a dock where I 19:57 can just sit down and go so that's my 19:59 ideas team i have a thumbnail designer 20:00 that is amazing at the craft of making 20:03 thumbnails that match and complement the 20:05 titles and then I have two god-tier 20:06 editors that are unbelievable with 20:08 coming up with graphics and animations 20:10 combined we have one of the best teams 20:12 on YouTube i'd put money on that and I 20:14 would never have been able to get where 20:15 I am this fast without that team now if 20:17 you run a business and you have the cash 20:19 flow to invest in hiring out your own 20:21 YouTube team I would strongly recommend 20:24 you do that there's really no better ROI 20:26 anywhere in content and marketing than 20:27 YouTube and I would not hire a one-stop 20:30 shop agency that does every role because 20:32 you're just going to get average 20:33 performance across the team with a super 20:34 fat markup the better way to do this 20:36 which is what I did is to hire out 20:38 specialists that are savages at every 20:39 single role and then stitch it together 20:41 if you want to hire out those individual 20:43 roles like I have with savages I've got 20:45 links in the description for every 20:46 single role and I'll connect you with my 20:48 team all right before I get to the 20:49 mindset stuff I just want to quickly 20:51 cover one more learning i call this 20:53 perception of quality i don't care what 20:55 people say in 2025 the perception of 20:58 quality matters in driving subscribers 21:00 your audio and video quality it matters 21:03 even if it only holds a viewer for a 21:05 split second more this increases your 21:07 chance of getting them to like you you 21:09 want to invest in this i think having a 21:11 high-quality studio having crisp 21:12 sounding audio having highquality edits 21:14 and motion graphics it all helps it's 21:16 not that you can't win without it but it 21:18 just adds tailwinds and increases your 21:21 surface area for luck and when you're 21:22 starting out and you're small you'll 21:23 take all the luck you can get i put a 21:25 free link below to a doc that lists four 21:28 different gear setups the fourth one is 21:30 all the stuff that I have here so if you 21:31 want to just copy my setup or use it for 21:33 inspiration the link's below all right 21:35 the last lesson that I want to talk 21:36 through is setting expectations when 21:38 you're trying to grow on YouTube life is 21:39 really just one big game of expectations 21:42 if you can set your expectations low it 21:44 makes it way easier to keep going with 21:46 YouTube because you're not going to get 21:47 as upset when the results are not going 21:49 your way most people quit because they 21:51 think they should be somewhere before 21:53 they actually should and this is all 21:55 just wrapped up in an expectation 21:56 problem in their heads so let me help 21:58 you set the expectations for what you 22:00 should expect when you're starting today 22:02 first let me paint the upside youtube is 22:05 a money printer if you're building any 22:06 business it is the best lead genen 22:08 vehicle period okay so knowing that you 22:11 should be willing to spend an unlimited 22:12 amount of time and lots of money to 22:14 build that machine now here are the 22:16 negative expectations and the pain that 22:18 you will probably face you're going to 22:20 spend at least 12 months trying to get 22:21 this off the ground with almost no 22:23 traction no income and no success and 22:25 when I say 12 months I don't actually 22:27 mean 12 months i mean 50 video reps so 22:29 if you're lazy and you only do two 22:31 videos a month instead of four it's 22:32 going to take you 24 months at some 22:34 point the traction is going to start 22:35 ticking up but it's going to take you 22:36 thousands of hours you need to expect 22:38 your videos are going to suck for a very 22:40 long time like I said before I've made 22:42 400 videos thousands of hours in front 22:44 of the camera thousands of hours editing 22:46 and even now I'm just hitting 100,000 22:48 subscribers on YouTube this is what it 22:49 takes and to describe it I use this 22:51 concept of the artist gap the distance 22:53 between where you are today with skills 22:55 and where you think you need to be will 22:57 be huge in the beginning it's going to 22:58 feel insurmountable you have to keep 23:00 going and trying to close that gap down 23:02 at the end of 12 months you should be 23:04 around 10,000 subscribers and rounded to 23:07 the nearest whole number this is going 23:08 to be about $0 per month in AdSense from 23:11 YouTube but it could be hundreds of 23:13 thousands of dollars if you have a 23:14 sophisticated backend and some efficient 23:16 business model now for a sense of scale 23:18 I do about 400,000 views a month and I 23:20 only make 3K per month on AdSense from 23:23 YouTube this is not an AdSense play 23:25 that's not why you're doing it now I 23:26 know setting expectations in this way 23:28 can be a little harsh and blunt but to 23:30 be honest it's easier if you can set 23:31 your expectations low and stay happy 23:33 throughout the process the last thing 23:34 I'll say is this the reason sticking 23:36 with it is a guaranteed win on YouTube 23:39 is because the bar to succeed is just 23:41 high enough that almost no one is 23:43 willing to do it that's why there's 23:44 value there all right all right now 23:46 before we close if you're an 23:47 entrepreneur I'm just going to quickly 23:48 summarize the exact steps that I would 23:50 take to replicate my success if you want 23:52 to do it like I did these are the exact 23:54 steps to take step one is to pick an 23:56 audience avatar that you can stick with 23:57 for a long time and is best aligned to 24:00 your offer if you don't have an offer 24:01 yet you need to be able to make 50 24:02 videos for this avatar without stopping 24:04 step number two is to plan for 50 videos 24:07 one per week over 12 months and expect 24:09 zero traction you need to focus on one 24:12 incremental improvement every single 24:13 video step three begin posting weekly 24:15 and do not miss a week under any 24:17 circumstances step four focus on 24:19 packaging and ideas above everything 24:21 else figure out how to drive that click 24:23 curiosity in the title and thumbnail by 24:25 focusing on some audience painoint then 24:27 drive the click confirmation in the 24:29 intro step five have something valuable 24:31 and differentiated to say in every 24:33 single video if you don't do more 24:36 research assume that every video is 24:37 going to cost you $1,000 to make would 24:40 you spend $1,000 on this rep if not you 24:42 need to go back and find a more 24:44 differentiated angle step six if you 24:46 have cash flow hire a professional team 24:48 across all four workflow areas as soon 24:51 as possible step seven plan for zero 24:53 outliers across that entire first 12 24:55 months if the universe does gift you one 24:58 try to reverse engineer exactly what you 25:00 did so you can replicate it step eight 25:02 trick yourself into loving this process 25:05 if you do not love it and you hate it 25:06 all the way it's going to suck all you 25:08 have to do is get to 50 videos with your 25:10 best effort and incremental improvement 25:12 and everything will open up and change 25:14 this is the best ROI on anything you can 25:16 do so focus on that and step nine if you 25:18 want further help on the strategy I will 25:20 open up a few slots for consulting calls 25:22 below i rarely do this it's first come 25:24 first serve there's going to be a link 25:26 below all right guys that's all I've got 25:27 for this video i just want to say if 25:29 you've ever watched liked
