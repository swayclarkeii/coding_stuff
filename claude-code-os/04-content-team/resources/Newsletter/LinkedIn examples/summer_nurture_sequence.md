## Email #1 (July 27): LEARNING PROCESS - Involvement Over Punishment

**Subject:** I saw blood and went into autopilot...  
**Preview:** And I was about to become my father...

---

**Hey {First_name},**

Here's what happened during one of those tricky evening moments for me.

I walked into the room and found Montego bleeding from a gash on his forehead, wailing while my 4-year-old daughter Zero was standing there looking guilty.

**You know that moment when you know something happened, but you're unsure of exactly what?**

And without giving her the benefit of the doubt, I lost it.

What slipped out was: *"Zizi, what the hell did you do?"*

And there I was: triggered on autopilot.

**But I immediately caught myself. Took three deep breaths. Told her everything was going to be okay.**

I took care of Montego - cleaned the blood, got a band-aid, comforted him. 

And I realized this wasn't the right time to address what happened.

Later, right before Zero went to bed and everything was calm, I pulled her close and made sure my tone was neutral:

**"Zizi, you're not in trouble. I just want to understand what happened earlier today."**

She was relaxed and opened up. Then I asked her: **"Did you see his tears earlier? How do you think that made him feel?"**

She thought about it. After a few moments: "Not good."

**"What do you think you could have done differently?"**

Another pause. "Hmm. Talked instead of hitting? Like when I'm mad, I could say 'Montego, that makes me angry' instead of pushing him?"

**Problem solved. By her, not me.**

Two things hit me: 1) Wrong timing on my part. I was way too amped. 2) **I almost punished my daughter for lacking a skill she hasn't mastered yet.**

She hasn't learned how to handle frustration without hitting. She wasn't being "bad" - she was just unskilled. **She's four. What can I expect?**

When I involved her in solving the problem instead of punishing her - **game changer.**

She actually learned. **I know what you're thinking - 'But she hurt her brother, she needs consequences.' That's exactly what I used to think too.**

**But she learned just differently, and she felt trusted instead of shamed in the whole process.**

**Most "misbehavior" isn't defiance. It's just kids being unskilled kids.**

I'm starting to see this pattern everywhere - in every battle, every meltdown, every moment I want to punish instead of teach.

**Most "misbehavior" isn't defiance. It's just kids being kids without the skills they need yet.**

When we teach instead of punish, when we involve instead of impose, everything gets easier.

Soon I'll share the biggest myth that keeps us stuck in tantrums, meltdowns and punishment cycles.

Trust yourself, you're closer than you think!

## Email #2 (August 3): MYTH-BUSTER - Punishment Cycle

**Subject:** The worst parenting advice I ever followed...  
**Preview:** That turned our evenings into pure chaos

---

**Hey {First_name},**

I need to tell you about the worst parenting advice I ever followed.

**"If they're not listening, you're not being strict enough."**

Sound familiar?

For months, every time my kids didn't listen and I was in a power struggle, I heard that voice: *You need more consequences. Stricter rules. Firmer boundaries.*

So I tried it.

More timeouts. More privileges taken away. Stricter bedtime rules. Harsher consequences for every little thing.

**And guess what happened?**

**The behavior got worse. Much worse.**

More meltdowns. More defiance. More evening battles. More bedtime fights.

So naturally, I thought: *I'm STILL not being strict enough.*

**I was stuck in what I now call that beautiful consequence spiral.**

Bad behavior → More consequences → Worse behavior → Even stricter consequences → Chaos

But here's what finally broke me out of it:

I realized I was treating my kids like they were choosing to be difficult, when really **they just didn't have the skills yet.**

Think about it this way: If your child was on your basketball team and kept missing shots, would you bench them? Take away their ball?

**Of course not. You'd give them the ball again and help them practice.**

But when kids can't regulate their emotions, can't calm down, can't share nicely... we punish them for missing the shot instead of helping them practice.

**I know what you're thinking - "This sounds too soft, too permissive." I thought the same thing.**

**But here's what I discovered: there's a difference between being soft and being smart.**

**The breakthrough came when I stopped asking "How do I make them stop?" and started asking "What skills are they missing?"**

Can't share? They need practice with turn-taking. Can't calm down? They need emotional regulation tools. Won't listen? They need to feel heard first.

**Instead of consequences, I started giving connection. Instead of punishment, I offered partnership.**

And **EVERYTHING** changed.

Calmer evenings. Kids who actually wanted to cooperate. Problems that got solved instead of escalated.

**Kids don't need more punishment. They need more skills.**

This shift - from punishment to partnership, from consequences to connection - has transformed our home.

More on this approach soon.

Trust yourself, you're closer than you think!

## Email #3 (August 10): SUMMER VACATION MIXED FEELINGS

**Subject:** I love my kids but I'm dreading the next 4 weeks...  
**Preview:** The summer break dilemma

---

**Hey {First_name},**

Kindergarten closes this week for four weeks.

**And I'm having feelings I ain't proud of.**

Don't get me wrong - I love spending time with my kids. I really do.

But the thought of having them home every single day for a month in our tiny Berlin apartment?

**I'm already triggered just thinking about it. The noise, the yelling, the frustration.**

Here's what I keep telling myself: *"You should be excited. You should love spending time with your kids."*

**Here's what I'm actually thinking:** *"How the hell am I going to get any work done? And how am I going to survive the next four weeks?"*

**And then the guilt hits.**

*What kind of parent has these sort of thoughts?*

Look, if you have a backyard, a pool, or you live on a farm - I'm genuinely happy and a little jealous.

**But when you're living in an apartment with toddlers and nothing but a four square meter balcony?** 

And work doesn't magically pause because school's out?

When "just take them to the park" means getting everyone dressed, packed, sunscreened up and ready for a 20-minute expedition that might end in a meltdown?

**Sometimes the honest truth is: this is going to be really, really damn difficult.**

**And you know what? Thoughts like these don't make you a bad parent.**

It just makes you human.

**You can love your kids AND feel overwhelmed by the logistics of constant togetherness.**

You can want quality time with them AND worry about how you'll manage everything else.

You can be grateful for family time AND still count down the days until they're back in kindergarten.

**These feelings can coexist.**

Your love for your kids isn't measured by how excited you are about every single moment with them.

**It's measured by how you show up, even when it's hard.**

Soon... I'll share what I'm learning about making these intense together-times more manageable for you and your kids.

Trust yourself, you're closer than you think!

## Email #4 (August 17): PLAYGROUND COMPASSION STORY

**Subject:** Why we forgive bedwetting but not playground pushing  
**Preview:** The compassion gap every parent has

---

**Hey {First_name},**

During an interview this week, a dad shared something that stopped me cold.

We were talking about his 4-year-old's bedwetting accidents. His response: **"It's not her fault - she can't control it."**

**Then he said: "It's not like she pushed a kid at the playground or something. THEN I'd be pissed."**

I had to ask: **"What are your thoughts telling you in each scenario?"**

**Bedwetting:** "Poor thing, accidents happen. She can't help it."

**Playground pushing:** "Aw shit, not again. Now I got some parent in my face."

**"So you're embarrassed," I said.**

"Yeah, for sure."

**But here's what hit him:** The embarrassment was triggering his anger. He wasn't even mad at his daughter - he was mad at his own discomfort.

**Then I asked a question that changed his perspective:**

**"She's 4 years old. What if she's just equally unskilled at both things? She can't control her bladder AND she can't control her impulses when she's overwhelmed. Why the different compassion levels?"**

Long pause.

**"To be honest, I never thought about it like that."**

**Here's the thing:** Our triggers determine our compassion levels based on the story our thoughts tell us.

Sometimes the story is simple: "Not their fault."

Most other times, the story is far more negative.

**Same kid. Same skill level. Different trigger. Different story.**

In this case, when embarrassment gets triggered, suddenly the child becomes "defiant" instead of "developing."

Your child's skill level doesn't change based on the situation.

**They're simply and equally unskilled.**

The only thing that changes? The story your thoughts tell you.

Trust yourself, you're closer than you think!

## Email #5 (August 24): CAPABILITY SIGNS STORY

**Subject:** I accidentally discovered what capable kids do differently...  
**Preview:** And it shocked me

---

**Hey {First_name},**

I accidentally discovered what the most capable kids do differently - and it has nothing to do with grades or good behavior.

**Here's what shocked me:** The kids who melt down the most might actually be showing MORE capability than the quiet ones.

Look, my son loses it over his shoes. My daughter throws herself down if she can't get to her tower first. For the longest time, I thought this meant they were less capable than other kids.

**Turns out, I was completely wrong.**

When I started studying what capable kids actually do differently, I found three specific signs that anyone can spot. My kids failed all of them at first, but that just showed me where to start.

**Here are the three capability signs I wish I'd known about earlier:**

**The 30-Second Rule**
   Watch what happens when they can't open something. Capable kids wrestle with it for at least 30 seconds before asking for help. Mine lasted about 5 seconds. But here's the thing - that's just data, not failure.

**The Bounce-Back Test**
   When juice spills, capable kids cry WHILE grabbing a towel. They feel the frustration and take action at the same time. That combination? Pure capability.

**The Boredom Window**
   After "I'm bored," count to 10. Capable kids will create something - anything. Others just become your shadow, waiting for you to entertain them.

**Now here's what changed everything for me:** If your kid shows none of these signs, that's actually perfect. Because now you know exactly where to start.

These aren't character flaws or personality problems. They're skill gaps. And skill gaps can be filled.

Every meltdown, every "I can't do it," every moment they immediately ask for help - that's just them showing you exactly which capability muscle needs strengthening.

Soon I'll share the simple experiments that build each of these capabilities. No pressure, just progress.

Trust yourself, you're closer than you think!

## Email #6 (August 28): BACK TO SCHOOL TRANSITION

**Subject:** The 7-day trick that saved our back-to-school transition  
**Preview:** And why rushing it always backfires

---

**Hey {First_name},**

Last week, I watched a neighbor's kid have a complete meltdown on the first day of kindergarten. **Full-on, lying-on-the-sidewalk, screaming kind of meltdown.**

The mom looked at me with that exhausted expression and said, "We tried to get him ready all weekend. Nothing worked."

**Here's what I realized:** She was trying to flip a switch instead of dimming the lights.

After four years of back-to-school transitions (and plenty of my own sidewalk meltdowns), I've learned there are three simple things that make all the difference. **Not perfect solutions, but things that actually work.**

**Here's what I wish someone had told me before our first transition:**

**Start the Shift a Week Early**
   Don't wait until Sunday night to mention that school starts Monday. Begin shifting bedtimes and wake times 7-10 days before school starts. Kids need time to mentally process big changes. When you spring new routines on them, their little brains go into shock mode.

**Focus on Anchor Routines, Not Perfect Schedules**
   Pick three non-negotiables: wake time, meal times, and bedtime. That's it. Don't try to control every moment of their day. Once these anchors feel steady, everything else falls into place more naturally.

**Expect the Feelings (And Have a Plan)**
   Your kid will probably resist the new structure. They might regress. This is completely normal after weeks of summer freedom. When they push back, acknowledge it first: "I know this feels hard after our relaxed summer" - then hold the boundary: "And I know you can handle getting ready for school."

**The key insight that changed everything for me:** Kids actually crave structure after periods of less routine, but they need time to adjust.

When we honor that adjustment period instead of fighting it, the transition becomes so much smoother.

**For both of us.**

Soon I'll share what happened when I applied this same approach to our evening routines - and why it works for way more than just back-to-school transitions.
