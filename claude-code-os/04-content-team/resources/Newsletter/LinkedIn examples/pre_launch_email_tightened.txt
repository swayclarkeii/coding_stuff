Subject:I feel like she's just saving the tantrums all for me...Preview:why your kid's worst behavior is actually GOOD newsHey {First_name},This past week, I sent out a request for feedback, and one response stopped me in my tracks.A mom poured her heart out about her daughter's constant meltdowns, the exhaustion, the shame of public tantrums. But there was one particular line that really stood out:"I feel like she's just saving this all for me."And you know what? She was COMPLETELY right.I could feel the shame in that statement. Like somehow she was failing because her daughter acted worse with her than with teachers, grandparents, or other kids' parents.But what if I told you this is actually the best possible news?Think about it: Your child navigates their day around people they're somewhat unsafe around - teachers who might get frustrated, strangers who seem unpredictable, other parents who feel intimidating.They hold it together. Follow the rules. Keep their big emotions zipped up tight.Kinda like how some kids won't use the toilet anywhere but home. Hell, some of us adults still do this.The truth is, they ARE saving it all for you. Because you are their safe place.You're the person they trust most in the world to handle their biggest emotions without abandoning them.When my daughter Zizi melts down in Tesco but holds it together perfectly at her friend's place, she's not being manipulative. She's showing me she trusts me enough to let it all out.Instead of feeling shame that you're the "target," what if you felt honored that you're their safe harbor?What if their worst behavior with you isn't a sign you're doing something wrong, but proof you're doing everything incredibly right?Now, I know what some of you are thinking: "Okay Sway, that's a nice thought, but my kid is STILL screaming at me in Tesco. What do I actually DO about it?"Fair question. Because shifting your mindset is step one, but understanding what they're really trying to communicate through that behavior - and how to respond to it - that's where the real change happens.Trust yourself, you're closer than you think!SwayDad of Two | Founder, Honest About ParentingP.S.
