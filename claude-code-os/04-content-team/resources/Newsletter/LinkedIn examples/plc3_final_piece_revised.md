**Hey {First_name},**

Quick story: Last Tuesday morning, my son bit his sister. Again.

I knew exactly what to do - I'd literally just recorded the last video about timing. Wait until he's receptive, then teach. Easy, right?

Except my body had other plans.

Heart pounding. Jaw tight. That familiar rage building in my chest. And I'm standing there thinking *"I literally teach this stuff and I STILL can't stay calm."*

That's when it hit me - knowing the principles isn't enough if your nervous system keeps hijacking you.

So I recorded today's video about the ONE thing that actually lets you use everything from the first two videos. Without this, everything else falls apart the moment your kid really pushes your buttons.

This is the 20-second technique I use now when my body tries to take over. Not perfect at it yet, but it's changing everything.

Trust yourself, you're closer than you think!
