# Email Draft: Why We Forgive Bedwetting But Not Playground Pushing

**Preview:** The compassion gap every parent has

**Hey {First_name},**

During an interview this week, a dad shared something that stopped me cold.

We were talking about his 4-year-old's bedwetting accidents. His response: **"It's not her fault - she can't control it."**

**Then he said: "It's not like she pushed a kid at the playground or something. THEN I'd be pissed."**

I had to ask: **"What are your thoughts telling you in each scenario?"**

**Bedwetting:** "Poor thing, accidents happen. She can't help it."

**Playground pushing:** "Aw shit, not again. Now I got some parent in my face."

**"So you're embarrassed," I said.**

"Yeah, for sure."

**But here's what hit him:** The embarrassment was triggering his anger. He wasn't even mad at his daughter - he was mad at his own discomfort.

**Then I asked a question that changed his perspective:**

**"She's 4 years old. What if she's just equally unskilled at both things? She can't control her bladder AND she can't control her impulses when she's overwhelmed. Why the different compassion levels?"**

Long pause.

**"To be honest, I never thought about it like that."**

**Here's the thing:** Our triggers determine our compassion levels based on the story our thoughts tell us.

Sometimes the story is simple: "Not their fault."

Most other times, the story is far more negative.

**Same kid. Same skill level. Different trigger. Different story.**

In this case, when embarrassment gets triggered, suddenly the child becomes "defiant" instead of "developing."

Your child's skill level doesn't change based on the situation.

**They're simply and equally unskilled.**

The only thing that changes? The story your thoughts tell you.

Trust yourself, you're closer than you think!
