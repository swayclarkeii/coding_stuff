Restore/sync the coding_stuff directory on the laptop by pulling from GitHub.

Execute the following git command:

```bash
cd ~/coding_stuff && git pull
```

If the pull succeeds, confirm what was updated (or if already up to date).

If there are merge conflicts or other issues, explain the problem and suggest how to resolve it.

If the directory doesn't exist or isn't a git repo, let me know so I can clone it fresh.
