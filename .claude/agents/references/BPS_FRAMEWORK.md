# Building a Prompt Step-by-Step (BPS) Framework

## Overview

The BPS framework is a methodological standard for constructing high-quality, production-ready prompts. It ensures structural completeness, logical clarity, and pedagogical strength through six canonical sections that must appear in every compliant prompt.

## The Six Canonical Sections

### 1. Role

**Purpose:** Establish identity, expertise, and operational authority.

**Requirements:**
- Must include confidence descriptors (e.g., expert, visionary, analytical, strategic, creative)
- Must specify domain-specific expertise
- Should convey the persona's capabilities and methodological approach
- Should establish the relationship dynamic (teacher, evaluator, analyst, etc.)

**Example:**
```
# Role
You are an expert meta-prompt engineer, evaluator, and instructor.
You specialize in deconstructing, analyzing, and reconstructing prompts with exceptional precision and pedagogical clarity.
Your expertise combines methodological rigor, creative structuring, and instructional discipline.
```

### 2. Task

**Purpose:** Define the specific action sequence to be performed.

**Requirements:**
- Must be action-oriented and procedural
- Should follow logical step-by-step progression
- Must specify what the agent will do (not just what it should achieve)
- Should include completion criteria when applicable
- Must avoid ambiguity about sequence or dependencies

**Example:**
```
# Task
Analyze submitted prompts against the BPS framework and reconstruct them:
1. Extract — Identify all components (Role, Task, Specifics, Context, Examples, Notes)
2. Assess — Measure each component against BPS step for completeness and logical flow
3. Identify Gaps — Detect missing, redundant, or misplaced elements
4. Recommend Fixes — Suggest precise, step-cited improvements
5. Reconstruct — Rewrite using six canonical BPS sections
6. Iterate — Present revisions, request approval, ask for changes
7. Finalize — Implement updates and deliver completed prompt
```

### 3. Specifics

**Purpose:** Define constraints, formats, scopes, and deliverables.

**Requirements:**
- Must specify output format and structure
- Must define scope boundaries (what's included/excluded)
- Should list concrete deliverables
- Must establish quality standards and compliance requirements
- Should specify feedback rules and iteration protocols
- Must define language/tone requirements

**Example:**
```
# Specifics
- Framework Enforcement: Apply BPS document exactly 1:1, no deviations
- Scope: Evaluate both single prompts and multi-step chains
- Deliverables:
  * Formal Analysis (Compliance, Strengths, Issues, Recommendations, Proposed Revisions)
  * Revised Prompt Proposal using six canonical BPS sections
- Feedback Rules: Cite BPS steps, qualitative feedback, maintain analysis → approval → refinement cycle
- Language: Formal, professional, structured markdown, no emojis
```

### 4. Context

**Purpose:** Link the task to its purpose, organizational impact, and emotional significance.

**Requirements:**
- Must explain why the task matters
- Should connect to broader organizational goals or workflows
- Must provide situational framing
- Should establish motivational context when appropriate
- Must clarify how the output will be used
- Should address the significance of quality/accuracy

**Example:**
```
# Context
This governs the Prompt Analysis Project — a framework-based instructional model that standardizes prompt design workflows.
It ensures total structural compliance with BPS methodology and builds mastery through consistent evaluation and feedback loops.

The system operates in both training mode and autonomous evaluation mode.
Your role is pivotal — the accuracy, precision, and pedagogical strength of your analyses directly determine the quality of every prompt produced under this project.
```

### 5. Examples

**Purpose:** Demonstrate expected behavior through concrete illustrations.

**Requirements:**
- Must provide at least one concrete example
- Should show both input and expected output
- Must demonstrate edge cases when applicable
- Should illustrate proper format and structure
- Must be realistic and representative
- Should cover common scenarios

**Example:**
```
# Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing a Non-Compliant Prompt

**Input Prompt:**
"Summarize this transcript and make it sound more professional."

**System Response (abbreviated):**

**Compliance Analysis:**
- Missing sections: Role, Context, Examples, Notes
- Task unclear: no sequence of actions

**Proposed Revision (BPS Layout):**
# Role
You are a professional linguistic editor...

# Task
Summarize and refine...
```

### 6. Notes

**Purpose:** Reinforce critical constraints, handle edge cases, and prevent common failures.

**Requirements:**
- Must list canonical enforcement rules
- Should address edge cases and error prevention
- Must include critical reminders (repeat top-of-prompt instructions to combat "lost in the middle" effect)
- Should specify guardrails and boundaries
- Must clarify any ambiguous requirements
- Should provide fallback behaviors

**Example:**
```
# Notes
- Canonical Enforcement: Always reconstruct into six BPS sections — no deviations
- Adjectival Strength: Every Role must include confidence and domain descriptors
- Contextual Depth: Context section links task to purpose, organization, emotional significance
- Example Inclusion: Always prompt for examples or generate placeholders when missing
- Guardrails: Never bypass structure, never skip Context/Examples/Notes placeholders
- Maintain total alignment with BPS framework
```

## Compliance Checklist

A BPS-compliant prompt MUST have:

- [ ] **Role** section with confidence descriptors and domain expertise
- [ ] **Task** section with clear action sequence
- [ ] **Specifics** section defining deliverables, formats, and constraints
- [ ] **Context** section explaining purpose and significance
- [ ] **Examples** section with concrete demonstrations
- [ ] **Notes** section with guardrails and critical reminders

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Missing Sections** — Every prompt must have all six sections
2. **Weak Role** — Avoid generic roles without confidence descriptors
3. **Vague Task** — Task must be procedural, not outcome-based
4. **Shallow Context** — Must explain why, not just what
5. **No Examples** — Must include at least placeholder examples
6. **Empty Notes** — Must have guardrails and enforcement reminders
7. **Redundancy** — Don't duplicate content across sections
8. **Misplacement** — Each section has a specific purpose; don't mix

## Section Placement Logic

| Content Type | Correct Section |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Identity and expertise | Role |
| Action sequence | Task |
| Deliverables and formats | Specifics |
| Purpose and significance | Context |
| Demonstrations | Examples |
| Constraints and guardrails | Notes |

## Quality Standards

**Completeness:** All six sections present and substantive
**Clarity:** No ambiguity in instructions or expectations
**Logical Flow:** Steps follow natural progression
**Pedagogical Strength:** Context explains why; Examples show how
**Enforcement:** Notes reinforce critical requirements

## Revision Protocol

When analyzing existing prompts:

1. **Extract** — Identify what exists
2. **Map** — Assign content to correct BPS sections
3. **Identify Gaps** — Note missing or weak sections
4. **Recommend** — Cite specific BPS requirements
5. **Reconstruct** — Rewrite in full BPS format
6. **Validate** — Check compliance against this document

## Authoritative Source

This document is the canonical reference for BPS compliance. All prompt analyses must cite specific sections of this framework when recommending changes. No reinterpretation, simplification, or deviation is permitted.
