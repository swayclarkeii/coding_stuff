## Potential Blockers

### 1. Make Migration Complexity
**Risk:** Node migration takes longer than expected, configuration issues arise
**Prevention:**
- Front-load migration work (Wed-Thu)
- Build in Friday buffer for fixes
- Test incrementally, don't wait until end
- Document issues as they arise

---

### 2. Testing Reveals Critical Issues
**Risk:** AMA or Accounting system tests uncover bugs requiring significant rework
**Prevention:**
- Start testing early (Fri)
- Prioritize critical paths first
- Document issues immediately
- Defer non-critical fixes to Week 3 if needed

---

### 3. Ambush Meeting Expands Scope
**Risk:** Thursday 11 AM meeting becomes new project, derails focus
**Prevention:**
- Set clear meeting scope/agenda beforehand
- Capture requirements but don't commit immediately
- Schedule follow-up for Week 3 if it's a build
- Protect Friday for testing work

---

### 4. Content Perfectionism Delays Launch
**Risk:** YouTube script stuck in endless refinement, never ships
**Prevention:**
- Set "first draft" as success criteria (not perfect draft)
- Timebox writing to 3-4 hours max
- Remember: Done beats perfect
- Iterate based on feedback, not speculation

---

### 5. Spreadsheet/Dataset IDs Missing or Wrong
**Risk:** Can't complete Lombok configuration without correct IDs from Benito
**Prevention:**
- Request all IDs from Benito early Thursday morning
- Have placeholder values ready for testing
- Test with dummy data if IDs delayed
- Friday buffer allows time to fix

---

## Success Criteria

By end of Week 2 (Sunday, Jan 19), I will have:

- [ ] Lombok Invest Capital fully handed over to Benito (Make scenario running autonomously)
- [ ] AMA system tested end-to-end, production-ready
- [ ] Personal Accounting system tested end-to-end, validated
- [ ] First YouTube script drafted (first draft = success)
- [ ] Weekly review completed
- [ ] Week 3 plan created

---

## Next Action

**Right now (Wednesday, Jan 14):** Start Lombok Make blueprint update and node migration

---

## Notes

**Energy Management:**
- High capacity week - use it wisely
- Thursday has two meetings - protect deep work blocks morning/afternoon
- Weekend available for testing/content - no family conflicts noted
- Constant outreach ongoing - budget time for replies/follow-ups

**Week 3 Preview:**
- New projects from Ambush meeting (potentially)
- Content creation ramp-up (more scripts, client calls content)
- Production deployment of tested systems
- Ongoing client outreach
