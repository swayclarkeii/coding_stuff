## Decision Log

**Decision:** Pursue automated document processing solution
**Rationale:** 5-10 hours per deal is unsustainable for growth
**Impact:** Initiated discovery and solution design process

### December 9, 2025
**Decision:** Email forwarding workflow vs. client portal for Phase 1
**Rationale:** Simpler, faster to build, doesn't change Eugene's current workflow
**Impact:** Phase 1 focused on backend automation, Phase 2 for client-facing features

**Decision:** PipeDrive integration is critical, Motion is nice-to-have
**Rationale:** Eugene manually updates PipeDrive for every deal; highest ROI integration
**Impact:** PipeDrive integration in Phase 1, Motion deferred to Phase 2

**Decision:** 95% accuracy threshold for AI document identification
**Rationale:** Eugene needs to trust the system, but some manual review is acceptable
**Impact:** Extensive training data required, confidence scoring needed

**Decision:** German language primary, English secondary
**Rationale:** 95% of documents are German official documents
**Impact:** ChatGPT API supports German well, focus training on German document structures
