# Social Media Automation - Information Request

Hi Nicole,

To design the best social media automation solution for A Mother's Touch, I need to gather some information about your current setup and workflow. Please answer the questions below as thoroughly as possible.

---

## Current Volume & Patterns

**1. How many Instagram/Facebook inquiries do you receive per week on average?**

**2. Can you send me screenshots of 10-15 different Instagram/Facebook conversations from the past month?**
- Please include a variety: simple inquiries, complex requests, and any that were particularly frustrating or time-consuming
- Remove any personal information if needed

**3. What percentage of social media conversations typically turn into actual orders?**
- Your best estimate is fine

## Account Setup

**4. Is your Instagram account set up as a Business account, Creator account, or Personal account?**

**5. Do you have a Facebook Business Page connected to your Instagram account?**

**6. Have you completed Meta Business verification for your accounts?**

---

## Budget & Goals

**7. What's your monthly budget for a social media automation tool?**
- This would be an ongoing subscription cost

**8. What's the #1 question customers ask that wastes the most of your time?**

**9. What information do you ALWAYS need to provide a quote that customers never give you upfront?**
- For example: number of servings, delivery location, event date, budget, etc.

## Workflow Preferences

**10. After the automation qualifies a lead through social media, what would you like to happen next?**
- Should it email you a summary?
- Create a contact in Dubsado automatically?
- Send the customer to your order form?
- Something else?

**11. For qualified leads who are ready to book, should the system:**
- Keep the conversation in Instagram/Facebook DMs, or
- Direct them to your order form?

**12. At what budget range do you immediately know a lead isn't qualified for your services?**

## Escalation & Boundaries

**13. When should the automated system hand off the conversation to you directly?**
- For example: customer specifically asks for the owner, complaint, very complex custom request, etc.

**14. Should the automation respond 24/7, or only during specific business hours?**
- If business hours only, what message should customers receive after hours?

Please send your responses at your earliest convenience. The more detail you can provide, the better I can tailor the solution to your needs.

Thank you!
